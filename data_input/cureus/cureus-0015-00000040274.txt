00:02	Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day how did you get started with all this I didn't come into this world the way everybody else does I don't think I used to think that everybody had the similar experience but like if I asked you what was your first memory in life what would it be I don't think I know my first memory was almost like when you're dreaming and you're falling and you hit the bottom and you wake up mhm that was my first

00:48	memory but I didn't wake up here I was inside my mother's womb and I was about maybe 6 months inside the womb and I'm like okay don't forget I'm here okay okay don't forget don't forget don't forget don't forget you go to sleep wake up again now something's moving in front of you and you're like oh that's my friend but I had a different name for it I didn't know it was my hand but I knew I had a title for it go back to sleep all of those things then ultimately you get ready to come out I

01:27	remember all of that you remember coming out remember being compressed you know and there you want to panic but there you're flooded with like some serotonin and dopamine to where you feel relaxed you go right back to sleep you remember being born I remember being circumcised I remember the whole nine and the proof of it was when my wife mea that you just met when she was 6 months pregnant with my son Kieran I wanted to prove to her what I was talking about so I put a light on her stomach every day at 6:00 at night

02:02	and I would move that light back and forth and I put a song on for a week straight on Saturday after a week I didn't put the light there and I didn't do the music and he pushed up on her stomach and then when I put the light there he started following the light and for the next two months we did this every night and he would go all the way around her belly back and forth always pushing on it you know I didn't understand at the time that maybe I've interfered with the development process and maybe he's wrapped the cord around

02:41	his neck I shouldn't have done all of this but it came out wonderful and fine and this little boy first thing he wanted to do is see light he loved lights from that early stage and I can ask him the square root of two the square root of five the square root of that the square root of Pi the square and he will run it off run it off but he's just like his personality is like Forest Gump you know to where he's just loving and wants everybody to be around him and and and Care um but for me that's where

03:17	it started in there and then when I was about 5 years old um I had another dream and this the room filled up with like this fluid a dark fluid and I could see the ripples of it moving around and there was a being there and I remember being walked through that fluid with him and I was trying to look up at him and I couldn't turn my head to look at him and he had his hand straight I knew his voice but I did not know who who it was but I felt confident and comfortable and as we moved along this dark blue fluid path

04:00	um with like chartreuse covering the uh you know how when you look into a pool and you see the Ripples and if you're at the bottom of the pool you see the ripples overlapping that's what it looked like and then when we got to the end of it he said to me if you could have anything in the world what would it be now we were really poor my dad had just gotten out of prison you know for manslaughter I didn't have much but I said to him I want to know how everything works and at that moment he used his left hand and he

04:40	opened up the door and there was this Mansion big brown doors and inside of it was these crystallin flowers big crystallin flowers like a giant like 5T across and every time I tried to see his face he would reach in and hand me another shape and I was so fascinated with the shapes because they didn't look like the platonic solids they didn't look like anything I'd ever seen before and he would hand me these shapes and each shape was different and amazing and I woke up from that dream but after that moment anytime

05:16	something strange would happen in a dream I had the powers of inception anytime something I would be naked at school I would say I'm not naked I must be dreaming and immediately I would run out of the school or run out of wherever I was and I would find that Mansion again and I had access to all the knowledge the proof of it is the 97 patents that I have now the proof of it is the industries that I've innovated it's like waking having a dream that you have a diamond in your hand and out of nowhere you wake up and

05:51	you're hoping you're holding it and you try and hold it and it's gone when you wake up but the proof is all the stuff that I've been able to do now so these all these thoughts these thoughts are from the time you were a baby these are not things that you've learned these are things that you had in your mind from the time you were born from before that time because I remembered that I had been someplace else before now what's interesting that voice that I heard that's my voice now so it was like my greater self

06:30	was leading me through and periodically would show up again in other dreams and I went off and became an actor because my mother wanted my little brother to be an actor and I thought if I became an actor you know I would get my mother's affection it wasn't until my mother was dying and I'm talking to her and she told me the reason that she was babying Antonio was because he had asthma and my father always questioned whether it was his son or because he looked so much like her family and didn't look so much

07:04	like him and I realized my God if I had followed my proper course I could have saved my mother because the knowledge that I had you know I had the the grand unified field equation I had already put that together and at at 78 I was working with these things and then I went through all of the hell that I had to go through being accused of domestic violence all of of those things and I thought it was a curse at the time but it was really removing me from advancing down the wrong path and during that period of time I started waking up in my

07:43	dreams again and I start going back into that that Palace and I remembered all of these things and I started patenting them as I moved along I got in touch with um Michael Hudak he was the president of the University of Science and philosophy because I was was studying um a guy named John Keeley you know who had worked with frequency back in 1870s had built the first um the first uh what do they call it um self- sustaining engine um back in 1872 but he wouldn't tell people how he built it and I was watching a program with with Dell ponds

08:24	who was and somebody in the audience said doesn't John keeley's work remind you a lot of Walter Russell and a bell went on and so I got in touch with the University of Science and philosophy after watching some stuff about Walter Russell and and um and uh Michael Hudak you know took me under his wing and started talking to me but he was more into the philosophy and the love that Walter was talking about but I my intention was to rebuild the periodic table you know build a new periodic table cuz the stuff I had learned in in

09:02	college you I went to school for chemical engineering the first year over at Pratt and they at the time I think it was like 108 elements and I asked I told the teacher um the professor about um the relationship between hydrogen on the spectrometer and carbon and silicone and Cobalt and I was like it's the same exact color same tone just doubled in each octave and he was like no each element is the same element and it will always be that element I was like you don't see the relationship so I left school and I was going to spend 40 years

09:38	rebuilding a periodic table and I found out that Walter Russell had already did that and he did it based upon the natural curvature of everything and when you say rebuild the periodic table what do you mean specifically well the way the periodic table is laid out the the periodic table they have now it looks like a box it looks like a straight box mhm and they don't show the relationship that between every element there's between every there's two no the all right here's the periodic table you'll see hydrogen sitting all

10:15	the way over there by itself but they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as as carbon what do you mean by Tone same tone same key of E same key of E 40.5 Hertz the next one would be like um 81 Hertz you go to silicone it will double up and would be 162 Hertz you'll go to to to Cobalt and it'll be 324 Hertz it's you know in that base if you were to take the angles of incidents or the tones that they create you know their color like you can turn color back into sound based upon it's

10:55	the same wavelength it's just twice as long or much longer so you have to do is keep dividing light by two keep that up jimy you keep dividing light by two and you'll ultimately get back to the audible sound of it because there was a relationship between light and color sound and tone matter and shape I put um I I sent over Walter Russell's I was trying to get to that that's what yeah it's it's Walter Russell's periodic table that he put together now you compare that to what men menof mof's periodic table you'll

11:35	compare Walter Russell's to it and you'll see something completely different it's unwinding whoa It's unwinding and you see there's a relationship that hydrogen so you you had figured this out at a young age I had already seen this this is it this was all inside of this was all inside of that Palace I had asked access to it and I knew the relationship saw this in dreams I saw it as a circle everything was a full circle laid out and each area was just expanding like wrapping uh a rag around your hand the first wrap you

12:15	know it's so tight the very first rap is so tight that's the first one that Walter Russell did yeah but go back to the um the wiggly one this is how I saw it more so but as a vortex but you'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen carbon silicone Cobalt rodium they're all bonded they're all sit be as the middle point between two noble gases so those things don't really exist it's only one substance now the problem is the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen that's the first visible

12:57	element because before it is to dense for us to perceive it you understand what I'm saying okay but as you reach into the next octave the carbon octave and they call that the a bisexual tone because the carbon has two tones to it it has a negative side and a positive side the part where lithium behaves lithium is a is contractive burum is contractive boron is contractive but the moment you get to carbon you balance it out it gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus 4 so it's a double tone then nitrogen is minus 31 minus 3 oxygen is

13:45	min-2 Florine is minus one now the balance of this all of those are mates Florine and lithium naturally mate if you have lithium bonded with any other element the moment that Florine is introduced it will break all bonds violently so it can bond with Florine same thing with burum and oxygen that's why it said and what they've tried to keep from us if you have you want to break water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen all you have to do is introduce burum or the sound of burum and and oxygen will violently break away

14:25	from any other thing even hydrogen to B B with that brillium and now you can have it just if with the frequency of it and since the hydrogen is smaller hydrogen will that waveform you can send that up into one tube the oxygen into another Tube without using electrolysis without using heat it was just through frequency and the proof of it if you go back up just a little bit higher we know the relationship between sodium and chlorine they're equal and opposite mates if you get out of the pool cool and you got chlorine and you're itching

15:01	from the chlorine all you have to do is get some real salt and rub that on your skin and it'll turn right into an oil it naturally neutralizes each other so everything has an equal and opposite mate the the lithium becomes sodium in the next octave doubles the same exact tone just doubled and and wider the sodium becomes potassium in the next acve widens up the reason that arsenic kills us is because our DNA has nitrogen and it has phosphorus in it because nitrogen unwinds into the next octave right after

15:42	silicone and becomes phosphorus our DNA has both of those in there but it's going by Tone so the moment arsenic which sits as a minus three on the next octave the moment arsenic is introduced the body thinks that oh this is my thing that I need and it tries to wrap itself around the Arsenic but it causes the DNA to unravel because it's four times as large as that nitrogen was and those other little elements titanium vadium chromium magnes Magnus and and iron all of those those aren't true elements

16:20	those are isotopes those things those first three are the full tones they make full spheres but now it becomes elliptical with titanium vadium and chromium and on the other side it's like when like I said if you wrap the rag around your hand the first wrap really tight you can't get much out of it second wrap damn near can't see the difference of a third one you start you start seeing hydrogen the fourth wrap you see carbon I need a piece of paper or a rag and I can show you that twist but in between each one of them by the time you

17:00	get nature does not allow us in the silicone octave for there to expand out but there is the same titanium badium chromium magnes and iron that exists between aluminum and silicone but nature doesn't allow us to unravel that but now with the wave conjugations we can we couldn't do that before because we didn't know the angles of incidents that were necessary to open these things up and you couldn't do that with the platonic solids because the platonic solids were averages and approximations they like I've said a

17:40	number of times you show me a real straight line in nature if everything in the nature if everything in the universe everything is expressed in motion all motion expressed in waves all waves were curved every action has an equal and opposite re reaction so the greater the action the greater the reaction the greater the reaction the greater the resistance the greater the resistance the greater the curvature because the universe is based off of equinity which Einstein left out in his theory of relativity the balancing side

18:16	of the gravity gravity was caused by electric force electricity is always seeking a higher pressure condition it spends Northeast is trying to get to the center of an area the center of a cone but the next electric wave is coming so it gets pushed out and as it's pushed out it gets to the vortices and that's some of on those pieces those vortices now instead of it spinning northeasterly centripetally it's forced to spin centrifugally and it spins southwesterly and it expands itself out it decays it keeps decaying until you

18:53	get four magnetic waves that hit each other at 120° angles at that point they reconvert back into the electric field and then they make their way back to their Source again whether it's the star whatever star it came into what happens when we get older we expand at our equator right we get shorter at the top why because the electric force is pushing in and condensing and the magnetism expands out at the Equator the the El Ron field the electrons that's just discharged electricity devitalized electricity

19:35	coming from the Sun coming from the earth it's the waste product from it but it hits our magnetic field and then it gets pulled right back in and gets compressed again and now it becomes electricity for the Earth and then it pushes itself right back out again at the Equator the equator is 5 miles wider than the than the poles electricity Einstein left that out of his equation because he coupled electricity and magnetism together and didn't realize that electricity was the equal and opposite of magnetism

20:13	electricity being the the the contractive field you breathe in that's a contractive thing you breathe out that's that's a magnetic thing a radiative thing but they use the term magnet as an attractor but to magnify something means to what make it larger increase the space that's the work of radiation that's what Walter Russell was talking about all those years that's the work of radiation it's the electricity between the things that pull them together the kulam force that supposedly Opposites

20:47	Attract and push each other away if that was true then hot air and cold air would seek each other out they're the same substance but just under a but in a different state one is they move in opposite directions from each other hot water and cold water move in opposite directions from each other the reason two magnets seem like their the North Pole is attracted to the South Pole because if you had two rivers or two holes two hoses with water coming out of them and you pointed them at each other what are they going to do they're going

21:18	to be pushing against each other but they align to where the male enters the female and is able to come out so they've been fooled by their sens say they've been fooled by their eyes and and and have missed the whole picture of it are you familiar with um khil gabron yes he wrote a book he wrote The Prophet you know 1923 but he wrote another book called um sand and foam in that book he told a story of a man who had been away from his family for four months working and he was excited to come home and as he was coming home he

21:57	knew that the mountain when he saw the mountain that he would be able he was close to home so his five senses started having a conversation and his eyes says I see a mountain I see a mountain I see a mountain and so the ears perked out and said I don't hear a mountain the nose sniffed and said I don't smell a not Mountain it's the tongue tasted the air I don't taste a mountain and the other four sentence senses started speaking among themselves and they came to the conclusion that there must be something the matter with

22:32	the eye because they couldn't perceive it but all of these things we've been misled just because we've been fooled by our senses our eyes see point 05% of the entire electromagnetic wave we're blind cosmically but we judge everything by what we see and they've done that with science for so many years you look at E equals c^ squ that talks about expansion it doesn't it does not show how it's divided if ever you've never breathed in twice without breathing out you breathe in and you breathe out you charge and

23:13	you discharge there's no so how is it that the breathing in they're acting as if the universe is just expanding out expanding out breathing out breathing out and it's going to dissipate out and they never include the contractive side of it breathing in because they were misled by Newton who said everything moves in a straight line unless affected by something else and we know that not to be true but they built the entire two-dimensional plane the ukan space that we live on that we work on that we try and Define

23:53	curved Nature by two-dimensional space and we never include the curvature the breathing in like um Alan watt said um no one would be attracted to a ukian woman because she would just be straight all straight lines it's the it's the wiggliness it's the curvature that brings the balance everything has to have the balance you know the the the electric side and the Magnetic side I I can talk about it but I can show you even better if you can um can I can I stop you there this the concept of the periodic table the way the periodic

24:38	table conventionally is addressed do they address these things as being isolated or intertwined they interact but they feel that carbon will always be carbon and it will have its Half-Life and it's and it's and keep breaking down but it still be carbon they don't understand that it unwinds and becomes nitrogen nitrogen unwinds and becomes oxygen so this the periodic table that the conventional use of the periodic table and what is this other gentleman's name again Walter Russell Walter Russell Walter Russell's

25:17	version of the periodic table how is Walter Russell's version of the periodic table perceived by people who study this well now everyone wants to use it if you can go to my in my book there's a there's a picture of Einstein reading Walter Russell's first book um second book The univers of one because when Walter wrote this in 1926 he sent it out to all to 300 different universities and physicists and one of the quotes that Walter Russell that um Einstein says on his deathbed I should have spent more

25:53	time reading Walter Russell's work that's how and now they're taking it under their wing but remember the Michaelson Morley experiment from 1877 1887 there they were trying to prove whether there was an ether or an effect of an ether or the quintess the quintessence that everything came from that used to be called the The Fifth Element that everything in that from Antiquity everyone understood that nothing just something doesn't come out of nothing it's like when you look at the air it looks clear but you change

26:33	the pressure condition the balance of the change of pressure condition we call that condensation it creates clouds and you change the motion conditions whether it's moving quickly or slowly it's going to become snow it's going to become rain it's going to become Hil so everything comes down to just one of two forces either you're breathing in and filling up something or you pouring it out but the scientists they ignored Walter Russell's work because he didn't include any equations inside of it he he talked

27:10	philosophically regarding how things behave in comparison to laying down and following some Newtonian or calculus writing you know he said he based Things based on let's explore them naturally and that's what I did with my book once what Walter Russell was missing he didn't have the wave conjugations he didn't have the the mirror shapes the all shapes and that was because of a mistake that was made 6,000 years ago maybe they took the Flower of Life which was that symbol mhm um if you could go to my book tcot

27:52	tlc.com there's an example that I put in there um on page 64 and I show the period I show the element the fundamentals if you could possibly pull that up Jamie was that again T TC tlc.com you'll see in there the mistake that they made because they believed in straight lines because the church was promoting the idea of straight lines you just tap on right below there there's yep download no just go to the center of the page and right above that and you see initial public draft just tap on it and if you go to page

28:42	64 on the right side of the page right there on the left side of the page you'll see the five platonic solids now these all of our axioms all of our postulates have been built off of these things this is what uet went down to Egypt and pulled these things together Pythagoras worked on them and these were the Undisputed fundamentals of God that he used to build if you tap on to the Flower of Life platonic solid things it's going to take you to a video Turn it you don't have to but it'll show you

29:15	the flower of life that they took this from but you'll see that instead of following the natural curvature of these 64 circles overlapping they average the space where they where they met and they invented straight lines they why did they do that because they believed that the world was flat they belied the world was flat at the time and the church promoted Pythagorean theorem comes off of this cube a s plus b s equal C so they wanted to use all of these intertwining circles and create straight lines because that's

29:59	how they thought everything came down to straight lines they thought the world was flat and I was like oh my goodness they didn't open the flower properly so the next one would be the icosahedron now the Flower of Life ex it's very very old the concept is very old what what was the origin of the concept it's the oldest symbol known to mankind I it's believed that it was Ani the brother of En if you go by the emerald saman text yeah the Samaran text that was the one that created mankind because if you look at Mankind and

30:38	there's a point I want to make with it I want you to stay on the book go back to page go to 134 on the book and this is what that o other gentleman being told me to do he said why don't you just take the pieces that make up the flower and put them together based on universal ratios so if you once you able to pull it up 164 page 134 134 in the book so this is the ju the pose of the mistake they made yep just tap right onto that yep just tap on it now this was made by David Johnson one of our programmers Argos fuel so if

31:19	you go to the far left and tap on that this is I took four of those triangles and wow and you can scroll around this is what happens when four bubbles meet this is the negative space where they can't touch each other this is hydrogen and as I was saying electricity is always trying to get to the center of that triangle but it gets pushed out and now you see it has four contractive poles which is the electric poles just go around it from like horizontally yeah it has four contractive FES cuz electricity is Seeking a higher pressure condition and

32:02	forcing it in where magnetism is Seeking a lower pressure condition and spun out so the vortices those tips that's the magnetic field that's where they begin but it has an equal attractor and an equal amount of repulsion so if you go to what happens when eight bubbles me they gave me the patents to that I called that the tetran this is so this is the negative space in between eight bubbles eight bubbles this is a negative space where eight bubbles meet and you can scroll around and this is ignored when they're

32:35	concentrating on straight lines completely cuz this if you look from the top I haven't violated anything it fits perfectly inside of there but this is the negative space where eight bubbles meet but you'll notice it has eight contractive poles but it only has six magnetic Poes six vortices so it has a greater electrical potential than a repulsion so maybe this is the strong nuclear force and the previous one was the weak nuclear force so I was like okay I caught this the hunti and after my son so I was like what happens when

33:06	six bubbles meet if you'll go to the one right in the center now you see that they has these huge bubbles fast moving but there's six strong spheres that's going around this but the greater attractor has grabbed the two weaker attractors and this looks just like a photon and guess what it has 30 poles what is the speed of light 299 299 mil 752 th400 something they rounded off to 300 300 million kilometers per second squared but if you look at it from the top you'll see that I haven't violated

33:48	anything this looks like what happens in nature so I was like okay so they gave me the patents to this but you'll see that there's six unaccounted electrical poles to it so I was like what happens with 12 bubbles meet if you go to the one right next to it another stable structure that we basically see in nature but there's four unaccounted electrical poles to it four spin around it you can count those four you'll see one at the bottom and three on those sides this is the basis of crystallization laws of

34:25	crystallization that forms and you can go to the last one I was like what happens when 24 bubbles meet this is a negative space if you pull to a horizontal on it this is a negative space where 24 bubbles meet this is where you cannot distinguish this from the background because all of the electrical potential has been accounted for this would be the Bose Einstein condensate where where something is becomes indistinguishable from the fabric of space itself the final state of matter something and the proof of this the platonic solids they

35:06	have a thing called discrete symmetry you can put the cubes together maybe you can put the dodecahedrons together but you can't put all of them together but you can take the wave conjugations right here and they form super symmetrical systems where everything align so there's a a site that that James sent over to you and you'll this will be the final thing and then I'll I'll be quiet for a second but I cuz this is the final this right here now these are sculpt other sculptures I've built there's a a

35:43	video um and you'll see that flower you if you'll pop it up from Terry's Lynch pens that that he sent you you'll see and that this was one of four super symmetrical systems that I patented and the reason I patented it was because when Walter Russell put his stuff up you have just go down a little bit and we're going to get to grav not that one we're going to get to gravity in a second not that one we're not even there yet there te tetr Teran wave conjugations now these are all of those

36:19	systems put together this is the where 12 bubbles meet the aurian m and then I put five of them together and they make these natural starfish but then when I put 10 of them together they lay themselves out and they predict all distribution of matter within the electric field and you can see where six bubbles meet on the as you get to a higher point on it those where six bubbles are meeting still fitting perfectly where the 12 bubbles are meeting and where this where the four and where the eight that's a super symmetrical system I put

36:58	12 if I put 20 of those where six bubbles meet the antonians they make a natural decahedron that's naturally curved if I take where the 12 bubbles meet that's where I made the Lynch pin from ultimately from some of those pieces you got right there that all shape of it so that was one of the first things but when Walter Russell came out with his book and he introduced his periodic table he watched as different people went up and collected Nobel prizes for derium for tridium for all these things that he had discovered

37:38	and I was like okay let me wait until the patents are granted before I'll talk about it so that they won't be able to stop it but what makes more sense where they invented straight lines in opening the flower or where you actually take the individual pieces of the flower and put it together they're based on universal ratios which one do you think is how the givers of that knowledge intended for us to use it well it makes sense because you're accounting for the negative space and the straight lines are not Bingo

38:13	yeah that it must be something and so and then these these are all physical representations that you've created yep that are all all the of those things same things that's the auan right there how is this received like when you talk to people about this oh man they they first because I didn't show them I hadn't shown them I introduced it with let's talk about our fundamentals are a little bit off there are no straight lines right so I reached out to Neil Degrassi Tyson Neil degr Tyson I saw him

38:46	at an event um upfront you know at Fox and he was like hey man yeah I'd love for you to come on my show do my radio do my TV thing I would love that I was like yeah but let me I've got something I want to introduce to you um and it was only 36 Pages it was a treaties and I told him it was controversial and I sent him over that the 36 page thing that had the wave conjugations in it but I started it off with 1 Time 1 equaling 2 and he went in on my treaties wrote redlined everything you attacked that I

39:26	had immediate that I talked about Walter Russell and Victor Shaw Berger and John Keeley as and Tesla as the people that I looked up to he attacked them but then he started attacking you know the 1 Time 1 equaling two how did he attack them oh he was he was because I asked him I said it I said under what conditions I said it's illogical where the square root of of a number added to itself will equal more than that number squared but that what happens with the square root of two that's what happens with most of the numbers I was like how

40:02	is it that multiplication if it means to make more and increase in number how is 1 * 1 equaling one part of the multiplication table now I understand that it if you're seeing it one time right but we call that once but the moment that you had that add the times in there that multiplicative indicator that means there is more than one so now each equation is supposed to be balanced you know that equal sign is supposed to show that there's a balance between these two numbers over here and a balance on this one over here what

40:39	happened to the other one in this equation it does not it didn't equate and then I took the square root of that number I took the square root of two because all this started in third grade I was arguing with my teacher because we're talking about the square root of 100 oh my God so your phone yeah that's my um detox thing I'm supposed to detox right [Laughter] now how how do you detox detox on a timer what do you do there's uh my wife got me these things you know because supposed to take this what is

41:19	that and pure body extract and um there's another one Advanced daily cellular talks what's in this oh oh boy I get glasses what's in this stuff just things to counteract the natural met the metals that we have in our bodies that that wear us out and you just take these periodically throughout the day on a timer I got I got to do it now I got to do it okay I take a Dropper part of that dropper and then four sprays and it it removes the parasites from your system like oil of oregano like using oil of orgo instead of using um um

42:01	antibiotics and have you felt an effect yes yeah what do you feel when you take this well I used to have really thick dark circles under my eyes that's gone away in the last six months I've been using that my skin I'm 55 years old I'm 55 years old and I smoke do I look like I'm 55 years old you don't you look great and you think that's because of this I think well I'm going to show you a picture of what I used to look like when my wife met me and I don't know if you could she' be

42:41	mad if I threw this up but she she's she's she's she's a beautiful one but um this is what I looked like when my wife met me I was 256 lbs were you eating differently um I was well now I'm intermittent fasting I follow her routine but she turned me from that into this it's like she shined up yeah you look about 15 years younger now yeah and that's because of her I still smoke my cigarettes why do you do that of a crackhead I don't know I don't know everybody has to have some Vice like Alan wat said you got to

43:34	have some some balance of beneficence and and rascality to you we have a fan in here by the way if you wanted to smoke in here you're more than welcome to I don't trust people you know I walk around oh I'm just people get so offended by gurus a lot of times and yogis because they think they're these calm and passive people when they get angry they're like oh that that was that was a directed angry that was that was a purposeful anger to to wake you up to something they and then they find out

44:02	they have a girlfriend they find out that they smoke and they're like oh this is a lie right but that's the real person that's what I loved about Alan Watts he had a wife and he had and he had his Mistresses he ended up dying with one of his his girlfriend and his wife you know often in his little place but he spoke the truth he was honest life is about the give and take there's a balance in there you know to be human is to be flawed it's to be beautiful yeah it's part of the beauty of us and it's part of the

44:37	create why we create I I don't think you create from a a perfect place of Enlightenment I think part of the chaos of being a human being is the beauty of the creation it's why why we create the most [ __ ] up people the best artists are some of the most [ __ ] up people my favorite musicians my favorite comedians my favorite actors yeah almost all of them are [ __ ] up yeah my uncle used to call it he said if you you don't get any flower to grow unless you throw some [ __ ] on it so back to Neil degrass Tyson and

45:13	this critique of Tes he threw [ __ ] on on he was like well Tesla's Tesla stuff worked but Tesla was never really respected and out there and he wanted I guess he wanted me to support bore or Shrink or or Fineman or any of those people and I'm looking at the Fineman diagrams I'm like you made all these things up you've got you're basically doing the Mr Spock thing if you want to find the answer to something then you cancel out all the possibilities all other possibilities and you root it down

45:47	to one thing so that means going through the whole universe to answer one question and that's the problem with probability that's the problem with with uh Heisenberg uncertainty um uncertainty that's the problem with schinger all of those were just these probabilities because they had taken The Ether out they forgot the electromagnetic wave mhm it had to have a medium in which it followed on it had to have something in which it was moving on they don't exist in isolation no they do not and it it

46:18	cannot be the cause of its own action and effect can never be the cause of the action the chicken cannot come be the egg cannot be come before the chicken the chicken has to be there first in order to lay it it has to mate and what Einstein left out was the equal and opposite of magnetism so when he back to Neil degrass when he wrote his response to my paper and he said if you have any other questions you're going to have to see somebody else and he wouldn't take my calls anymore I was like okay so I

46:51	wrote the book based off of those responses and I reached out to another guy um Dr David Tong that would be ve very interesting that that would be his take as a public educator that he wouldn't want to talk to you anymore the reason I wanted to talk to him was because of his show the cosmos that he was doing after after that incredible guy you know Carl Sean did the very first episode he had was talking about um giodo Bruno MH and he said that gioro Bruno was looking for that grand unified field equation and maybe one day

47:26	somebody is going to do it and when they do it it's going to change the world and I'm like dude I've done it I've I've I've got it here he attacked it so with such vital that I I was like oh okay maybe I need to walk away from this Dr David Tong from Cambridge a professor of Cambridge did a video on on on physics of the world and he said it's all a lie and he he explained that there was these 16 Fields you know that they everything that they had taught was this and they gave the best understanding and

48:05	interpretation that they had of it but it was all Al lie because they didn't understand how it worked why because the Michel and morle experiment from 1887 where they were trying to Define The Ether or the Earth in this etheric space problem was they kept with Newtonian laws so they thought the ether didn't move they thought it was still but there was another guy lore that did it in um early 1800s and he went off of Thomas Young who influenced the fornel lens came you know influenced Fel who came up with the Fel

48:45	lens but he talked about a a moving ether that had opposing vortices so I didn't learn all of this stuff until I was getting ready to have conversations with people cuz I was looking where has this work been done but if you look at at um giodo Bruno's work it looks a lot like my stuff but he still had straight lines and I think he put those straight lines in there to appease the church oh wow so that he wouldn't get killed oh my God and they still killed him they hung him upside down in 1600 the Catholic Church 1599

49:23	hung him upside down in a steak and set him on on fire because he refused to recant that the god that they were talking about was not the true God of the universe it was much larger than that their story went back 6,000 years and there's other traditions and and tribes around the world where their stories go back 200,000 years and they made a lot more sense so how if we limited ourselves you take Noah having three sons shim Jeff and and am and one was black one was Asian and one was white does that make sense to

50:03	you but we had we we we we subscribe to that we subcribe to that dogma and everybody's entitled to whatever opinion they want to have I don't think that opinion is right we're going off in so many different directions I do want to talk about this I do I do want to get to this because I would love to know your your what you believe happened but the Neil degrass Tyson thing is so confusing to me that he so he was critical of Tesla he was critical of Tesla he was critical of Walter Russell and he was

50:33	critical of John Keeley are the this not this is not his field of study though right no he's astrophysic he's an astrophysicist but Walter Russell talked about that the Earth Walter Russell talked about the fact that the sun gave birth to the Earth that it didn't coales from some field and the proof of this do you guys know that the Earth is drifting away from the Sun yeah yeah at this is the mistake I made at at the Oxford act they because they wouldn't allow me to bring my notes or anything so I said the drift

51:05	was the drift was 6 in a year it's 6 Ines a year M so if you add up how long it would take the earth to move because and all of the planets in every solar system is drifting away from their primary at the same exact rate like one 1.5 CM so this is a universal expansion that's happening with everything moving away so them saying the and the web telescope have proven that those galaxies couldn't have formed 13 14 billion years ago but if you would just add up linearly how long it would take the earth to go from the Sun to 93

51:49	million miles away it's n trillion hold on let's go I I put I did all of the little calculations these are not little calculations hold on D get I love that expression but little well man don't turn my phone off don't do that every time I get ready well cuz I know they're watching me right now and they're mad at me whose day um the people that want that our entire world economy is based off of the politicians and the authorities that give their politicians their accredidation and those authorities

52:35	those universities are all based their their entire curriculum is based off the platonic solids and our world economy is based off of 1 * 1 equaling one you think they [ __ ] with your phone oh I'm sure of it cuz now I couldn't even I have to turn it off for a do you ever drop your phone you ever dropped your phone I've dropped my phone a number of times but you ever think that that might be what's going on with your phone and then I buy another phone and the same thing happens I'm five minutes burners I

53:02	I used to but then my wife would think I was cheating so I was like no I don't need that I don't need that I made that mistake way too early you know in our relationship and it cost me eight years of of toil and pain but I ultimately made it back and I'm so glad that um you know we produced 1500 spurn per heartbeat women are born with 200 to 500,000 eggs in each of their ovaries they don't get anymore the amount of buildup the need to reproduce for males is is great and we're 98.7% identical to to simeons to

53:41	chimpanzees what do they have they have a herum by Nature mhm there's only a 1.3% differentiation between us and them and that 1.3% is supposed to dominate over the 98 I'm just glad I'm 55 now and sperm production to slowed [Laughter] down um you know you could always get a phone that you don't use as anything other than contact a couple people yeah but this that would work but I I'm like if they're going to hear they're going to hear yeah well that is an issue so so this is the math this is the math so it

54:21	would so 5 5,000 5,280 ft in a mile 12 inches in the foot therefore um it's 6 1 mile equals 63,360 in so the number of years that it will take for the earth to move one mile is 10 15,600 years so that in order for the earth to reach where we are at 93 million miles it would take 9 tril 820 billion 800 million years for the earth to get here likewise Mars at 147 Million Miles Away From the Sun it would take 15 trillion 780 billion 480 million years for Mars to get where it was so at a given point Mars was here in the goldilock zone and

55:15	now Venus is going to inherit the goldilock Zone next the sun will give Mercury is under a higher pressure because they're still under the Miss Mis mistake thinking that there's a void in space so they forget that mercury is under the highest pressure possible so it can expand it's like hydrogen it's like those octaves before hydrogen so the atmosphere the iron isn't able to release any the oxygen and the oxides but when you get to 67 million miles away from the Sun the pressure is a little less but it's still so much

55:50	higher than the pressure than the pressure um on Earth it's like going deep into the very Belly of the earth that pressure is so very high and so now the clouds there there's a great deal of sulfur there's a great deal of of of of ammonia and all of those things in it but once Earth moves to where Mars is Venus is going to slowly move and will be right here you know in maybe five or six trillion years Venus will be right here and humanoids will appear again and unwind the same way and that asteroid belt that

56:29	we have right now between Mars and Jupiter that used to be a planet and I believe that they had humanoids that developed on there the same way that everything that's the periodic table they call it the periodic table because these things happen according to periodicity they happen under regular events you change the motion and pressure conditions the the crystall changes we call it a different element but it's the same substance like my hand is one substance but if I do it like this and do it like this and do it like

57:03	this it looks like a whole different thing and they can call it a different element but it's the same element under different motion and pressure conditions I believe that Sirus Cirrus used to be a planet when it was here and the humanoids on there didn't recognize that we don't have a solid core everything expands as a sphere and no sphere in our universe no bubble has a solid core we're perceiving it as a solid core but there is not a solid core there there's just a bubble and at CERN that hydron collider that particle

57:39	accelerator I believe they did the same thing and they popped their planet and it became that asteroid belt really just take it if you add up all of the weight of the mass of those of of the asteroids in the asteroid belt it will probably equal the same mass as that of Mars I thought the concept of the asteroid belt was well first of all there's the concept of Earth one and Earth two right so Earth one was a planet that was hit by a planet and that's how our moon was established when when have we seen that happen in nature

58:18	well we haven't seen it yet right but these things take a long ass time and we don't have a whole lot of ability to see things our ability to see things even with the James web telescope is fairly limited right which is one of the reasons why they're able to find these galaxies that should not have been able to be formed in such a short period of time to the extent that they have which confuses them if they're looking at this 13.

58:44	7 billion year old Universe these things should be much older right in order to be this size in order to be in the position where they're at so you believe that the Sun is the origin of these planets of all the planets every solar every Star within its solar system gives birth to all of these other planets this is what Walter Russell had talked about this is what Neil degrass and they attacked him for because he talked about the drift this natural drift and that wasn't it more didn't make more sense and they didn't have the idea of dark matter and dark energy then

59:24	right they didn't even come up with that and now we understand 4% of the universe is visible and 75% of it 74 something 74 70% of it is dark energy and 20-some per of it is dark matter UNP perceivable things and they say that's because they needed to figure out how would they get the spin and create and have the the the the the uh galaxies why they spiral galaxies well what my team did did chrisy who's my um he's he's he's my Scotty we we use the same simulator that they use at Princeton and we took Lynch pins and we

01:00:10	haven't even introduced Lynch pins yet but it'll be a great introduction for it we took Lynch pens this configuration of where um where six pentagons me and we put them in particular order they're at the they there is a link for that right inside of the thing that that James James Pelini sent over to to you if you'll pull that up and we rebuild the planet Saturn without gravity and it has the rings with no animation it has the Rings and the hexagon that's observed at the very top of it without dark matter without dark

01:00:54	energy without gravity showing that it's outward inward outward Force pushing down that creates the planet if you can pull that up and he explains it out it's like 3 minutes long and where does the matter come from he used well the matter remember that's condensation if you were to picture before we watch it yeah before we watch it let let me explain something if you were to picture the waves at the ocean you know the darker the waves the deeper the water you can't see a distinguishing fact between them until they crash into

01:01:27	each other that splatter that that little foam that comes out it lasts for a couple seconds and then it settles back on there and it's just the balance between this force and this Force that's the physical Universe those few seconds that it takes that matter that more densed water and the foam to recois and get balanced again with the surrounding environment that that's the entire time that our universe or all these universes have worked together but if you play this this is at the very beginning of my

01:02:06	book that's why I went on that that at the emies and I was like look I've got a whole got something else to do I've been able to rebuild Saturn without gravity with no animation and then they clowned it of course they did this is not something that you could say in a sound bite which is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you this is not something like your explanation of these things and your description of the very nature of reality itself is not something that should be taken lightly no it's something that like thank you

01:02:40	for saying that it needs to it needs to be laid out and it needs to be slowly examined in every because you've obviously spent a lot of time working on this this thing here so play this Jamie and this is us what Jamie just to clarify what I'm going to play and turn it up hold on hold on there two different videos one's long one's short no this is going to be the short one the my computer just reset itself too because all these vit files freaked it out oh yeah the government man I don't know I was Neil degrass Tyson he knows

01:03:11	where youru video it would be the first one this one correct um gravity gravity is an effect is an effect of electricity so turn it up so cuz Chris does a full narration of it is it's still my computer still and he was talking to my wife and explaining to her what what he had worked on and it just it was this is seven years six years ago I think or maybe five years ago but as soon as it as soon as it allows you to It's let's see the center yeah rewind it just a little bit y okay here we go it's

01:03:49	just three minutes I have two groups of vortexes which are just like tornadoes tornadoes you know spinning tornadoes that are pointing towards the center as I highlight this object here you see it that yellow line right so there's there's a bunch of those in there there's actually 16 of them and I'll highlight them all hold on it's not doing anything see it's no it's about to happen no nothing's happening my computer just froze again is what I'm trying to say something freaked out by

01:04:16	my computer I might have to just try to you want to reboot I mean I think it already did I'll try again you hold on I have to pause okay no worries yeah that's what it should be doing but it's it's going to basically you'll see oh wait that's weird I have what's the matter what I can see on that screen is not what I can see on my computer screen I can't even see that it's the [ __ ] government man do you think it's not I think it is sometimes I assume they listen to everything I say

01:04:43	they do I'm sure they do you you took lot of boring [ __ ] you took a bold stand now years ago when the governments were trying to poison their citizens you took a very bold stand that nobody else took that's what I was like wow I appreciate you cuz I lost three four jobs because I refused to take it I refused to you feel better about it now especially when you know all these people that have health problems because of it cancers have increased 300% all cause mortality up 40% in some age groups pulmonary embolisms almost up

01:05:16	like 500% that Spike proteins that's being built and collected within the in the system we can go into I have a I can walk you through what the spike protein did to the brca1 gene that's that Gene inside of our our DNA that tells us that there's a damage there's damage that's happening almost like the crews that that go along the highway and they immediately put up cones every time there's a problem well this the spike protein which is never no no protein has ever been able to enter into the nucleus

01:05:52	of a cell not only did it does it go to the riboon and say Hey you know what I don't want you to produce whatever protein like if it was a skin skin cell you're not going to produce keratin anymore you're just going to produce these Spike proteins that Spike protein went into the DNA and it tells the brca1 gene turn off and that's the gene that says hey there's a mutation here let's scrap that thing and so now the cancers are building up the spike proteins weren't shedding from the body they

01:06:23	collected in the ovaries they collected in the lymph nodes they collect it in the bone marrow so now we have all of these diseases that's showing themselves because the body is overwhelmed trying to deal with the spike Protein that's attaching itself to the A2 and the endothelia cells in our um vascular system for everybody out there and the more boosters you get boom the wor turning your system off you're turning it off your body cannot defend itself and it's just collecting it's just collecting but it it ALS Al showed me

01:06:57	the bizarre state of human psychology that people if you're presented with what could be a potential solution you want to believe in it so bad that you're willing to defend these companies that have been the most deceptive companies proven deceptive Pro not just deceptive but deceptive in the way that they are allowed to distribute information they're allowed to not be transparent about their studies they could have multiple studies that show a negative cause or a negative effect and they don't have to they don't have to release

01:07:33	those studies why because they're bought and sold because they but I think it's an agenda to it you think so I think it's an agenda attached to it because they restricted any natural thing like ior mechon I IA means like um was it it it caused IV meon mechan for the Latin of it the it was it was worms and it was anti- worms and what the Ivor mecan did it's it causes the worms to have paralysis or parasites to have paralysis because it stops their information from passing it there's these things called

01:08:13	the nodes of Ron V between each neuron there's an axian and there's the um there's the axian and oh my God I just forgot the leg that comes off of dendr those dendrites and the axians have these these things called nodes of Rona where they're not allowed to touch each other and it transfers potassium and and chlorine back and forth to each other potassium chlorine chloride and and hydrogen back and forth well in the worm the icin stops that to where the worms become paralyzed so it was an immediate

01:08:49	defense against the the pathogen but they immediately shut that down and wouldn't allow anybody use it they showed that it stops viral replication completely in vitro yeah they know that they don't they know that there's a mechanism involved and they try to pretend and then they also tried to pretend it's dangerous which is insane and they even got Rolling Stone magazine on board with it where they they printed an article where they were showing these people that were waiting in line uh for gunshot victims because uh so many

01:09:19	people were overdosing on horse dewormer yeah well that was propaganda was it was a it was a full-on lie not only that the they were so stupid and clumsy about it that the image that they used this is Oklahoma the image that they used was like in the summer in Oklahoma and yet everybody's dressed in winter coats it was [ __ ] the whole thing was so stupid but so obviously coordinated it was confusing to me how many people were willing to go along with it and how many people were angry at people who didn't go along with it

01:09:50	regardless of what they were saying even if what they were saying was reasonable even if what they're saying especially if you're talking about like Jay bachara and you know these these people that were professors at esteemed universities and they were being silenced and there was a coordin effort coordinated effort to remove their post from Twitter this is wild [ __ ] unprecedented wild [ __ ] and the population was just going along with it for me what was fascinating was psychologically like do you guys not know about deception do you

01:10:22	not know about profit motive do you not know about the history of pharmaceutical drug companies in this country and what they've been able to get away with with how many people they've paid the Tuskegee experiment oh my God I couldn't understand how black people or people of color were running and trusting the government after what happened to them with the Tuskegee experiment and for people that don't know what the Tuskegee experiment was in the early 1920s um a group of government officials

01:10:51	came down doctors and they went through the black community and they said there's a sickness in all of you guys and we're going to cure it free of charge and they injected the black population with syphus and left it untreated for 60 years and just watched how it ravaged the body for 60 years it wasn't stopped until like 1970s late 70s that they stopped the experiment and I don't even know if they've paid reparations to the so the government has been using all of these chemical warfare or um biological warfare against its own

01:11:31	citizens for a long time constantly so many instances of it there's so many instance of it documented instance instances of it and that's the T SK experience one of the most horrific and the fact that it went on until the 70s is just [ __ ] terrifying but this is just the nature of having that much secrecy and control and profit motive and being able to enforce power on people and it's a thing that human beings have always done whenever human beings have gotten into position where they're ruling over

01:12:02	others they they are callous and and evil almost always almost universally there's not one instance of this amazing benign beautiful leader that transformed their society into this incredible Utopia it doesn't exist in history no animals and and insects you know not one of them are responsible for the eradication of any species on this planet right not one single creature from history but mankind is responsible for the death of for the extinction of millions even when animals are responsible for the extinction it's

01:12:44	because human beings introduced those animals into places where they didn't belong like cats in Australia all the birds yeah they killed everything so this is man interference and it's based upon their lack of understanding because they don't know how the universe truly works because their math has been off for so long because their fundamentals are wrong now everything has this expiration and there's a loss to everything when the universe is perfectly balanced when you utilize it properly and that's why I

01:13:18	wanted to introduce the wave conjugations and the mirror shapes and all of these things defining the electric field defining the magnetic field and the Constitution between them being the Lynch pin because the Lynch pin as you'll see in a second this is it has that same Center as that tetrion space the the magnetic field the feminine side all of this is circular that's the full expansion this is the common factor or the the Constitution between the micro and the macro that's what the Lynch pin was and that's what

01:13:54	we're about to see in the video did was was it able to come up Jamie all right here we go this is rebuilding the planet Saturn go ahead the sound was coming through your speaker is that what it was time for a new laptop no I don't know what's going on you know what's going on the government they do not want you I'm we're about to kill gravity we're about to kill their God gravity and they don't want that here we go from the beginning I have two groups of vortexes which are just like tornadoes tornadoes

01:14:43	you know spinning tornadoes that are pointing towards the center as I highlight this object here you'll see it that yellow line right so there's there's a bunch of those in there there's actually 16 of them and I'll highlight them all there and render that just so you can kind of see a little bit better so that's so they're all pointed towards the center but they're arranged in what we call the Lynch pin configuration I going pretend like you never heard of that so there's one on the top and then

01:15:23	three in groups of three around that are spaced at 120° apart and the tilt of these ones on the bottom here is 109.5° in relationship to the top ones that are creating this flat space on the top and the bottom and they're spaced at 120° radially and then inside the model is three groups Jamie this Sounds playing simultaneously no he got sound in the backgound oh that's my wife talking we're in the kitchen and he's just explaining over sky from this is the sky I was confused go ahead up to 1,000 PB from 2.2 PB to

01:16:10	1,000 PB and there's no gravity whatsoever in this model there's no Center attractor so it's just vortexes and two two magnetic fields a north and a South polarity and one one harmonic resonance which is emulating a vibration in the field in this region here where these vortexes are pointed so it kind of just oscillates to give it a little bit of Randomness in motion so that the particles will kind of interact and bounce around like smoke or water waves and water and then when I hit play it does it all by itself using physic simulation

01:16:49	so there's no animations at all in this model and when I play it this is what pops out holy [ __ ] wow and then when I look down at the top it makes the actual hexagon that NASA has observed on the top of Saturn without any gravity and you'll see that the you get a surface of the sphere on the inside with the heavier particles so the are you basically saying is this saying that you guys can recreate planets yes this is a this is a particle simulation of the physics involved in making of the planet Saturn wow like all

01:17:43	the yeah so the the heavier particles are creating the the red and the green can I pause this for a second so is he saying that just by doing these calculations it created the exact form of Saturn including the Rings just the exact form of it just with the so you change the angles of incidence that these Lynch pins cuz remember each one of these has these are opposing vortices so there's 12 vortices to this that that are opposing so once the angles of incidence change you can you change the motion and pressure conditions you can

01:18:14	now change the condition or the crystallization it all so I was saying with the periodic table now because we have the angles of incident material engineering can now separate the space between carbon and nitrogen or carbon and Boron and and have the same elements of titanium vadium chromium magnes and iron or nickel Cobalt nickel copper zinc gallium or geranium in those higher octaves we can do that between silicone and phosphorus or silicone and aluminum so the transparent aluminum now becomes possible because we can now control the

01:18:55	pressure and change the pressure and motion conditions where we couldn't do that before because they were going by cartisian space at 90 Dees and 45 degrees straight lines the ukian space that they've made up this orthagonal or church-like space that they've generated because they wanted to promote that cross that was the basis of all of that now we open ourselves up this is what happens when four bubbles meet this is the the negative space from when four bubbles are meeting that's hydrogen that's why when I went to um Uganda I

01:19:32	was like look look we have an entirely new system of hydrogen that I I've got a patent where we where we're able to you won't need projectiles in the guns anymore it's my if you pull up my patent for um projectile uh before we do that though should we finish this oh yeah finish it let's finish this and then Jamie did you also get I want to see a photo of that hexagon on the on the top of the of Saturn so let's play this it's just another minute of the thing I feel like we could do a 80 hour

01:20:10	podcast dude dude we haven't even got we're just introducing Lynch pans I know which is another Super symmetrical system I'm barely hanging on I think the computer no you're not no turn it up no I'm having a computer freak out again oh no yeah every time I'm shrinking this video it's it's just like it doesn't it doesn't like to do this huh I don't know what's going on F is it the codec I like I I have no control over the computer alt tab does nothing Escape does nothing yo space bar does

01:20:42	nothing maybe you dropped your computer maybe you dropped your computer Jamie I'm G to try to Jamie you need a burner computer yeah they don't want their God killed gravity has been the thing they've been holding on to from the beginning and it's just an effect of electricity it's the draft left over by electricity is it working now jimie it's re it's just did like another like false reset so let me get my stuff back together here but we've seen that portion of it so what I'm saying um

01:21:17	the yeah right there yeah all right we'll try oh [ __ ] hold on to many this is kind of funny if you you have has this ever happened to yall before no no no no fascinating yeah if you want to be paranoid always I'm not paranoid I am I'm a bit of a skeptic I'm a realist if it's NE if a is equal to B and B is equal to C then a is equal to C if this has never happened before and it's always happening to me maybe I'm just bad luck am I bad luck no here we go okay without any gravity and you'll see that the you get

01:21:53	a surface of the sphere on the inside with the heavier particles so the colors are you basically saying is this saying that you guys can recreate planets yes this is a this is a particle simulation of the physics involved in making up as like all the yeah so the the heavier particles are creating the the red and the green here where the hexagon is and those are the heavy ones creating the shell of planet and then the outside are lighter particles that are a fluid that's creating the counter rotation of the

01:22:33	atmosphere of Saturn like we observed scientifically and the red ones in the middle here are where the magnetic field is strongly polarized at the North and South poles which gives you aora Borealis I have a question now does this mean that you would be able to control what kind of atmosphere um the planet has as well like you can change that because you can create it that means you can change it we now have the system by which you can it's the arrangement of Lynch pins and the AIS they spinning relation to each other and or vibrating

01:23:16	by doing that we can create the condition any condition that we want so you can have human life here as what you say if you if you were able to if you're able to uh change and alter these external fields and had an understand like at least this would give us a method of studying it in such a way that we Now understand that it's external pressures being applied from the outside end not not the standard model where you have internal fision reaction a nuclear in a planet with magnetic fields from Iron cores Etc

01:23:52	going outward right that's all that's all kind of ego based at the center this is pretty solid evidence that everything we're observing is from the outside coming in so the entire universe is actually creating these planets from the outside in from space itself the pressure you can stop it now what so go to that image like if you picture dropping a pebble into um a a pond or a pool everything expands in these these longitudinal waves right perfect spheres unless there's something else in there

01:24:26	but when it hits the edge it all starts bouncing its way back and when it meets when these returning waves meet expanding waves that's when we get our first geometry so this is the proof that the universe is not infinite but finite because you could not have shape without the returning waves and the waves would not return unless it was bouncing off of the edge of something look how strange that is bingo look how strange that that hex gone on the top of the of Saturn is M or yeah that's Saturn right yep and

01:25:00	then we don't even and he that is so crazy he explains exactly how he built it all the angles of incidents all the the pressure systems that he used all of that is so it can be a repeated experiment but they've ignored this this is in the beginning of my book you go to my book that's the first page on there before you even open it up I've got this and we rebuilt the the Milky Way galaxy the same way and it predicts the star Arrangement better than NASA does and this is without Dark Matter this is

01:25:31	without dark energy this is without the standard model is dark matter dark dark energy are they primarily theoretical that's all theoretical they've never they've never witnessed it and we couldn't prove that Michaelson morle experiment that that they did in 1887 which said that there was no effect because they tried to move a table around and change the angle of incidence for light to see if the light changed when you move the table the experiment is like this the mental experiment is like this if you're going to experiment

01:26:02	you have an a structure and you have an idea of how a behaves and you have a thought that if you put a in a particular situation it's going to turn into B so let's picture it hypothetically like you have a bar that's maybe 6 Ines long of iron and you say okay well I think if it goes into the freezer that it's going to get shorter so you're supposed to have two exact bars 6 in out and leave one outside of the refrigerator freezer and put one in the FR freezer and then you compare them after you you see it so a

01:26:38	overx is equal to B over to R * b overx r is the result or the change between them B is the change that occurs r r is what faction or the x that you use in order to get back to a or to convert it to B what they did with the Michaels and morle experiment because they could not get out of the ether they couldn't step outside of The Ether because it's everything around us so they couldn't tell a difference whether they saw no result no change so they assumed there was a void that there was no ether there

01:27:16	and that's when particle physics took off lorence lorence a great physicist that everybody loved entered a paper in 1904 where he was continually explaining The Ether the same way that Maxwell all of his theories came off of there being an ether but he was still limited by Newtonian laws and the column force of opposite attracting when it's the positive it's the things that are alike that attract but he believed that the ether was still and space was flat and so SpaceTime or Einstein relativity came

01:27:53	as a result of them taking The Ether away and for a 100 years we've walked down this particle physics phys physics world that's all theoretical and here I've patented these wave conjugations that is the ether is the contraction of The Ether and the expansion of it and on top of that the proof of it was I've been able to build new industries from it if you go to um I want to introduce the Lynch pen if I can with all of the talk you before we do that can you tell me how a planet is formed under this

01:28:34	Theory so you have a sun and how does the sun give birth to these planets the same way we defecate and have gas like Jupiter's that that that Red Spot on Jupiter that's spinning on it that's going to become a moon it may take a a billion or two billion years that will ultimately become a moon off of Jupiter where is it right at the equator where do we discharge at right at our equator and then it will rotate its way around and slowly be pushed out by the solar wind of of well by Jupiter so like coronal mass ejections coronal mass

01:29:15	ejections so some kind of ejection of matter leaves the Sun and over billions and billions of years enough of it and there's enough of a force to where ultimately that coalescing idea that they have those are that's where it happens it's not from materials that's just been left over from The Big Bang you know like rert Shel sh sheldrick says you know the physicist of today ask for you give us one miracle and you know show us how everything came from nothing and we'll explain everything else and

01:29:53	they can't explain everything El else they can't un explain the morphic resonance that's happening between things like right now because I've discovered these wave conjugations every person on the planet that's been thinking about it will now have ideas concerning but not just us but all humanoids throughout the entire universe will now get that same resonance and be able to apply it like the experiments with the rats right you teach a rat something here in London and then in New York you find the rats are doing the

01:30:25	same thing right spontaneously because of the morphic resonance because we are all connected on this ether and that waveform is that's the Consciousness we are all just one great being yeah you know that's what they forget we're not separate we're all the universe is probably one cell inside of some super organism right and we're just little little who you know little who's like like Horton Hears a Who and trying to make sense of it and it's a beautiful thing that we're making sense of it but

01:31:03	everything is just one great being we're all God that's what Jesus was talking about that's that's what that's what you know Buddha was talking about it's it's recognizing the Divinity in you what I did as a child I said I'm going to instead of waiting for the Messiah to show up what if everybody body picked up their torture steak and behaved and did the things that they had expected the Messiah to do what if everybody just for one day walked around and behaved as if they were God himself and did the things

01:31:37	that they would expect the Creator and we know God can't just be a male because no man can produce a child without a female everything in the universe as above so below like Billy Carson always talks about you can't everything has an equal and opposite it has to mate mating is a big part of what we do the car the um the Boron mates with nitrogen and that's how the carbon happens everything inside of us all ourselves they're mating there's a relationship going on in it everything's alive there is no death but

01:32:13	that the Bible talked about a mechanistic world God took dirt and blew into it the breath of life and it came to life but if you look at the Brownian effect what is breathing going from positive to negative and they see all these even the plastic that makes these things up are still going from it's still it's still it's still carbon um polarizing from positive to negative breathing in breathing out it's just under a different state of matter but there is no death there's no death we are all everything's eternal and once

01:32:55	we forget once we get rid of the idea okay you're going to die and disappear you know then they don't have any graphs over you anymore and and to be free the truth will set you free you know that's why I was like okay well if I have to if this truth caused me this lifetime then wonderful I've accomplished what I needed to do because I think in the previous lifetime I was supposed to do these things and I didn't and that's why it's been so hard for me and that's why I've pushed so hard to get these things

01:33:25	out because so you felt like that like from the womb from the womb I had to get this you felt like you had these things that you didn't get out in a previous lifetime and now you feel like an Unstoppable urge I have to I have to at all costs so can I go I would love to talk more about this but I don't want to lose this thought so if I want to go back to the formation of planets so under this Theory these Stars eject matter and over time this matter will achieve a certain amount of distance from the Sun short

01:34:02	distance look at Mercury Mercury isn't that far from it right kind of makes sense and then over time it'll eventually get further and further out the sun will continue to make more and more planets over an imperceptible amount of time we won't be able to measure it it's for in our our world we'll see it it's appears static just like PL plants appear static to us but if you ever watch a uh one of those motion cap of plants yeah plants are moving and touching each other and they're just doing it at a pace that our

01:34:36	brain can't handle a different temporal Dimension yes so the sun is creating planets but it's doing so at a pace that our mind can't really wrap around so we want to think there just matter and that it's in it's flying through space and it's collects collects via gravity and The more mass the more gravity it's it's supposed to but look at the take a balloon another thing that kills gravity gravity is supposed to be the greater the mass is the greater the attractor you take a balloon you rub it

01:35:10	on your leg you put it over the ground watch the dust particles jump off the ground off this big Mass called the Earth and jump onto that balloon because why electricity is 1 37 times stronger than the pool of gravity or the effects of the so-called gravity it's the electric force that's the attractive Force it's the electric force that tightens everything together as the masculine and then the dividing force is the radiative force the magnetic field it oblates and pushes everything out and then they collect together again but

01:35:50	where these things meet at the proper angles of incident like the Berkland currents talked about those plasma currents talked about those angles of incidence is at 120° when it converts it back into electricity and it will keep collecting and coming and making life the planet isn't a dead thing it didn't just happen to come together that's just the process by which it was given life it's alive and it's screaming it thought we were going to be beneficial to it and now it's trying to kill us it's now it it

01:36:25	needs to scratch itself and get rid of us because we are too dangerous because we are using Antiquated fundamentals and like people say well what business do you have coming in here talking about science and all that you're an actor you want to know what my first patent was their entire AR VR world was built off of my first patent that was abandoned because I paid $260,000 for the worldwide patent but then my agents kept not my my lawyers kept sending me um these maintenance fees and annuities and I'm like these

01:37:00	folks are just trying to shake me down I'm not going to pay this well a year later if you would pull up My World of Windows patent I think it's one of the first patents up there I want you to see where your arvr world came from and you look at the list of companies that has cited and didn't just cited they built their entire arvr world off of my World of Windows patent can you can you pull that up Jamie if of the computer I'm yeah it's the very um not that one not that one not that one it's yeah that's the propulsion

01:37:37	patent eight no no no that's all you have huh really I'll check if you can go to Terry's Lynch pin I I'll show you on here this is is what the this is what we put together for is that online this this is online text me that link and I'll just send it to him yeah I got you got it you got it okay so merging virtual reality it says merging virtual reality with reality go down patents and files the very first one PO on that so you go and look over to you'll see my name inventor teren to Sean

01:38:25	Howard worldwide application and let's just read the abstract just so they system and method for merging virtual reality and reality scroll it so I can see it uh to provide an enhanced sensory experience a system and method of merging virtual reality sensory detail from a remote site into a room environment at a local site the system preferably includes at least one image server a plurality of image collection devices a display system compromising Display Devices a control unit digital processor and a viewer position detector

01:38:58	the control unit preferably receives the viewer position information and transmits instructions to the digital processor the digital processor preferably processes Source data representing an aggregated flow uh aggregated field of view from the image capturing devices in accordance with the instructions received from the control unit and outputs the refined data representing a desired display view to be displayed on one or more Display Devices wherein the viewer position detector dynamically determines the position of the viewer in the room

01:39:27	environment and changes the desired display view corresponding to position changes of the viewer now you see it this is all you this look look look at the Inventor go back go up a little bit and slide over say Terence thean Howard rry Paton 2010 it was abandoned now go to cited by you see that 131 cited by tap one there it's right under where it says abandon yep p Pat cited by 31 it's to the right yep right there top on there and look at all the companies and if you look at the patent these companies have all earned they

01:40:03	have multi-billion Dollar companies they've built off of my patent just roll through Sony Microsoft Amazon huet Packer yeah keep going keep going keep going I and it's still making money this patent has earned over7 trillion and you didn't get a pie and I haven't gotten a penny of it when they did all of the um black lives mattering like let rathon company and IBM IBM if you crazy there's and it still has another nine years another eight years in which I would be making money off of but what they didn't

01:40:42	know is they didn't understand is how it was really supposed to work so they've just been taking this gun and been using it as a bat and if they wanted to know I could show them how it really really works but this is proof that my stuff is legit is legit so let me ask you this before we stray away from this too much the the concept of gravity so if if it's all electricity that's causing these forces and it's all outside in when the Saturn 5 rocket is escaping Earth's atmosphere what is it

01:41:16	fighting against what that's fighting against is the rotation remember there's a centripetal sphin that's taking place with the Earth right and there's an electrical field that's generated from that that's that centripedal spin that holds things inside that's what it's fighting against that's that electric field and we're calling it gravity we're calling it gravity but gravity is just the effect of the electric field and gra and the electric field is balanced by the the radiative field and The more

01:41:46	mass something has the more it gets pulled the greater electric potential it has you know the so the more the tighter the heavier it is the waves are tighter electricity can now it doesn't have to jump over anything and as I showed you with some of the pieces as long as they're close together then you don't have the magnetic field that forms that that discharge because they're able to to stay South northeasterly in their Direction they're not forced to go southwesterly and spin out either you're spinning to the right

01:42:22	or spinning to the left that's that's the only two directions in the universe spinning to the right is Northeastern that's that's electric if it's spinning to the left it's magnetic and it's expanding out it contracts in fifths and expands in sixes and so now what I would love to do is invite Neil degrass and David Tong or any astrophysicist any chemist any any anyone in any field of science to sit down with me and examine these patn examine the super symmetrical systems that I've developed but I want

01:43:01	to show you Lynch pin now here I've invented here I'm an Oscar nominated actor that has known all around the world face recognition vocal recognition all around the world I've invented a new form of flight tangential flight the ability to fly around your own Center of mass something they've never been able to do and you don't hear anything about it and it's unlimited bonding if you can go to what um Jonathan Davis sent over he's one of the other programmers that work with us explain what it does

01:43:37	explain when you said flight what do you mean tangential flight what do you mean by that it means right now fix wi aircraft you can go in four degrees of Direction they go up down you know some can go forwards and backward you know backwards and right to left but this is a bble to spin around its own Center of mass completely spin around its own Center of mass something they've never people are able to do it by Falling but this is a sustained system that's able to go around I sent that that other video to you um but their ability

01:44:12	because this is the geometry of hydrogen any bond that hydrogen can make Lynch pin can make and what they're basically doing is building the periodic table in front of you if you would play um four of them coming together it's four like 30 second videos you know I'll explain it out but you'll see how these things align themselves well this is the Swarm and they're all following this queen as a colony and they'll do everything that that she's doing there's go to the very first video

01:44:46	there's four in a row on it oh that's how it came over to you well let's see which one this is this is four of them that's going to come together to pick up a barrel and and what's powering them um right now they're we're we're going to use hydrogen fuel cells but I have another system you know that I was going to talk about in a second but um it's an unlimited source of power so hydrogen fuel cells or you can use lithium batteries at so how are they moving like what is what are those is is

01:45:25	that like a are those like propellers yeah those are props but okay but that right there what we have right there is um uh it's it's a it's a pitch uh wow um collective pitch so instead of the props having to turn themselves around in instead of all the props having to turn themselves around to stop and turn in the opposite direction they just switch the direction they they just so it's a collective pitch and it changes and so now instead of going up you're going down but now five of them will come

01:46:02	together and watch what the five does with so this is the end of cranes oh this is the and how many is necessary and they can since this is the this is the fractal they can be as small as as a nanop particle or they can be as large as the universe because the entire universe comes down to this so I was trying to reach out to Elon Musk I was trying to reach out to Jeff basos I was trying because my main goal was I was building these to clean up the upper atmosphere all of that debris that's up there and ultimately to mine the the

01:46:44	the asteroid belt because you can't go out there they keep talking about going out there that's like you try and go that far away that's like us that's like taking a starfish from the bottom of the ocean and bringing up to where we are everything expands the nitrogen expands too much that animal dies you take us outside where Mars is nitrogen has expanded so much more the hydrogen has expanded so much more that you will never be able to you won't even have a spaceship or or a a suit on that's

01:47:21	strong enough to keep your body together and you will never be able to come back to 93 million miles away from the sun because everything will have expanded and you will expand to the point of vacuity and explode out so trying to send a Man Out To Mars is like trying to send a man to live on Venus the pressure is too tight near Venus we will get crushed in a second it's like being pushed to the bottom of the ocean immediately you'll get crushed IM immediately the pressure conditions change as we move from the Sun but

01:47:55	science have neglected that because they've said it's a void there and they don't account for that higher pressure condition but they found that radioactive decay is is quicker closer to the Sun near Venus why because the pressure condition that electric field and those magnetic fields are pushing on each other causing it to turn back into an electric force in comparison to further away when the sun when the earth is closer to the Sun they found the radioactive decay is quicker than when it's further away from the

01:48:29	Sun is that by accident or is it just because of the change of pressure condition so us talking about going out when my wife said on the thing are we going to be able to put people on Saturn no it's too the it's it's it's it's too too nebulous it's expanded out too far our pressure can we would have to have a suit so strong and powerful in order for us to do that but lynchpin is able to make it out there because we have another propulsion system that we've put together where I'm able to take water

01:49:01	and put it into a small change and this patent has been granted it's um the propulsion um projectile and we patented it as a gun because I didn't want anybody else to be able to use it like a gun but it's basically lightning in the bottle we take water and we put it inside of a small chamber based on the wave conjugations that I have and the angles of incidence and we run an electric charge through a small amount of water the water is not able to expand into gas like it wants to because it's

01:49:34	locked into the pressure condition so immediately it converts into plasma and it h it converts the gas Dimension into a power Dimension so it's lightning out of the barrel just from water and there's no in like with it's a real lightning gun like a quake yes so and the patent's been granted the typically you're limited to how much charge you can put inside of a cartridge and you know you have to get more and more charged or or or explosive in there to get something out but with with electricity you could send a th000

01:50:11	volts or a million volts through the same aperture and that water is UN incompressible and so it's just going to react and immediately it converts into a plasma and so it's we can project anything into space all of that has been accomplished and it's ignored so it can act as a propulsion system for Rockets as well Rockets anything and in space and that's the whole point for it to because there's just nothing but that but moisture and that Collective and ice in there so you can now the Lynch pins can go all the

01:50:48	way past Mars attach themselves to whatever Aster oid mine that asteroid bring it back and have in one of the lrange areas so for the audience out there lrange areas are those areas where two where multiple magnetic fields meet and there's no weight to something another death blow to gravity was the fact that it's not a constant it could not be a constant because things weigh heavier on the poles of the earth than it does on the surface of the poles than it does at the equator there heavier at the poles than they are at the equator

01:51:26	and the further away from the earth you go the less it goes so there's no consistency about gravity it is not a constant it is a coefficient and it's more so just an effect and it's the same thing with the plon scale you look at the plank scale or the plon length or the plon plonk weight all of those things are based upon gravity and they're supposed to occur at 10 15 10 Theus 15th the plun scale but these but at 10 Theus 35 is where the proton and all of that behaves they have gravity inside of there as if it's

01:52:07	affecting it but they've already said that at a at a small molecular level you know at the nuclear level gravity is H has no effect so how is that part of a plun scale you know there's a guy um Fleming that talks a lot about this but you take that you look at the speed of light is that a constant you know in 1928 they saw that there was different fluctuations between 1928 and 1948 between the speed of light and then out of nowhere and rert sheldrick talks about this out of nowhere they began to be a constant again where there were

01:52:43	fluctuations before and he asked one of the professors about it and he said oh it it's it's a thing that that we call um intellectual phase lock where when they get different measurements for the speed of light all of the scientists around the world will average it out to one thing instead of showing the fluctuations in it oh wow it's called intellectual phase locking it's not also because of the crude methods of measurement that they had available no they could they've been able to measure light the speed of light

01:53:14	since Galileo was measuring IO going around Jupiter and that's how they came up with the speed of light was how he watched IO going around Jupiter and saw that there was a difference in how the light behaved and they've been able to get very close measurements to what they thought was the speed of light but it's never been a constant because it changes depending upon the medium it's going through so there's no constant there but they have that as part of the plank scale but the Lynch pin the wave

01:53:45	conjugations the tetrion it's the end of it's the end of plun it's the end of scheringer equation it's the end of of of of um he Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I'm ready to to have the debate at any University anytime they want to it's but they have no comeback for it because I have four super symmetrical systems and that's the thing about geometry geometry is its own proof super symmetry is its own proof whereas equations anybody can have an equation and only certain people

01:54:23	can try and understand it and it can be fudged with renormalization where anytime they have an Infinity they renormalize it that's why Dyson left the whole group back in the 1940s when they were talking about Quantum electrodynamics and Fineman said it himself you know with this renormalization you know is that real physics is this real math all of them recognize that this is fudging because they went the wrong direction by taking The Ether out of the equation and now I have proof of The Ether and how it behaves

01:55:01	wow I wish I could really truly understand exactly what you're saying because I'm kind of getting it and you're doing a great job explaining it but if you're right that really changes everything everything and it accounts for why physics kind of hits a stalling Point they've been going in the wrong direction 96% to physics is unknown matter that they've had to make up to account for it and we were able to build Saturn without that we were able to show the extent the fact that it also has a

01:55:35	hexagon is very bizarre the age of the universe you can wind up all of the satellites all of the the planets in every solar system and can wind up and get back to the real age of our universe would be gazillion gazillion gazillions of years based upon this drift if you walk away from that big bang or special relativity because that was the cause of all that black holes came from the thought of of gravity going crazy when gravity goes crazy you know light won't even be able to escape from it because light was thought as moving as a good as

01:56:16	a particular CR that we've just killed that what do you think a black hole is doesn't exist there there aren't black holes there's no spot where the uni where energy goes in and never comes back out there's no place in the universe where where where um the the information Paradox occurs where there is an IM balance something gets contracted and never comes out that's not how the universe behaves it comes in and it goes out when Newton said that the that gravity pulls down if he had with that Apple yes the Apple was

01:56:52	attracted to like conditions on the earth it was attracted to like conditions if he had spent another week or two weeks watching that apple he would have watch the gases go right back up to where they were equalized everything if it comes this way it has to go this way you breathe in you breathe out it's filling in or or pouring out so what do you think they're detecting when they're detecting black holes with that shift that they're talking about that's that's the tornado remember there's a vorticy there's all

01:57:22	these huge vortices everything is spinning around a vorticy so a collection of larger vortices is going to have the same thing that's happening at the center of the Galaxy is happening at in the center of a hurricane it's happening in your toilet stool which is why the Galaxy is a circular disc in the first place everything all motion is expressed in waves all waves are expressed in curves it always makes spiral so because of the concept of gravity and because of the concept of this event horizon this super point of

01:57:55	gravity this infinite point that light can't even Escape that this exists because of the the gravity and their math remember they have a thing called zero they they they go from one to zero to negative one there is no zero to even think zero so do you think that zero is a concept that came along with currency it should be attached to currency in that regard because in physics there is it's either nothing remains still there's nothing still in the universe there's nothing that doesn't have motion

01:58:31	because everything is connected so if one thing is still everything that's connected to it has to be still there can never be one thing still so as electricity tries to get to its its balance state right when it gets there magnetism takes over and it pushes over so there's this pendulum and as soon as it gets to this state it bounces off that other noble gas and it makes it way all the way back over here and it's about to have equinity and then it gets pulled back into the other direction and that's the breathing in and breathing

01:58:59	out and the Pendulum effect that we've all observed a natural phenomena in the universe and that's a part of everything everything behaves that way every one of our cells every comes down to our cells are made up of water mostly water 80% 90% Water Somewhere water is hydrogen hydrogen has 12 tices that's behaving with it 12 opposing vortices so what in your model what happens to these Suns when they Supernova everything gets old and die everything gets old and die and does everything recompress has to and you

01:59:38	breathe out what happens to that air another plant breathes that air in so would this be the universe itself would it be galaxies would it be everything behaves the same way so as the sun expands and projects and ejects particles they expand they go further and further from the Sun and at a certain point they come back well at a certain point what do they hit there's other expanding stars and and and and um so like waves colliding yes and from the other from the other from the other star systems they have an expanding what

02:00:16	is the the thing the solar wind they have expanding solar winds so when they meet our our plant our star meets the solar wind from another star at that end of that spot now there's two pressure conditions so you have another lrange spot that's happening there that's when those waves start coming back but they get hit and they if they hit at 120 Dees because that's how the universe is arranged now these things become electric so they instead of coming from the planer side and expanding out at the

02:00:49	equator they now come back up from the nor Northern and Southern's parts so does this account for Stellar nurseries yes all of these things are just pressure conditions hitting each other and they're causing that that's where the berkeland currents are running through those higher electrical Fields but everything in the universe is just electricity and we call it magnetism when it's devitalized but it's still electricity we call the the the radiative side it's the feminine side and the the attractive side is the

02:01:23	positive the masculine side there it's a balance and it's never been it's never been anything but that balance and we've complicated it with a lie if you're right so many people are wrong everyone's wrong oh well the universe the universe backs me up and I have the proof of it you you have all these physicists that's saying something different but none of them have 97 patents none of them have introduced a new form of flight with unlimited midair bonding none of them have discovered four super symmetrical

02:02:01	systems this is what we've done this is what the collective is able to do when you put yourself into the Divine space because that spirit is waiting it's just like okay are you going to make yourself available for it so let me ask you this like if you if I had a magic wand and uh I allowed you to uh not just show this but allowed all of these people that have these opposing ideas you you debate them you doke it out you emerge Victorious okay with this magic wand and now people go just listen to Terrence what do we do well then once

02:02:40	we now we write new new a new axioms and new postulates based off the real wave conjugations now we adjust our understanding of our phys physics to fit natural phenomenon and then we are in balance with it and we have to let go of the idea of this currency we're the only creatures in the known universe that uses currency that uses an indirect form of payment instead of a direct exchange we have to get past that point and that's the hard thing because this entire world has run on that and that's where the 1 Time 1 equaling two came

02:03:20	into its into its real birth well the thing about currency is it's connected um to technological innovation because of this uh unlimited potential for growth and when you have an unlimited potential for growth you have people that are extremely motivated to make massive amounts of money and they innovate in a very high way and then they also Implement that innovation in the form of Technology but their technology is is Antiquated compared to mine there's no government on this planet that has the technology that I

02:03:53	have or can outdo what I have because you can't outdo the fractal how many people have you I know you spoke at Oxford about this but you didn't speak yeah they no they didn't Oxford did something that that broke my heart five minutes before the presentation they wouldn't allow me to have a screen and show and show my proof why oh their computer was down and I was like well you can use my computer no we have sensitive things attached to it you know I just need the projector I don't need anything else because they just they

02:04:26	didn't want me to go and talk about this and that's why I went out there and said hey pull out your calculator I talked about acting for a couple minutes for 20 minutes and then I was like pull out your calculator and I want you to enter the square root of two in there and I let's walk through this Loop that is the square root of two I was like let's walk through this where the square < TK of 2 cubed is the same value as the square < TK of 2 * 2 and then when you divide it by two and Cube it again you get back to

02:04:57	the you take the square root of 2 1.4142 13562 373 095 you Cube it it's 2828 4271 2174 6190 divid it by two it get back to 1.414 cube it again is back to 2.82a divided by two back to 1.414 here we're making here we're taking one two three big steps we're dividing it by two and we get back to the same value as we had in the very beginning that's a loop that's X Cub being equal to 2x which is equal to X Plus X that's an unnatural equation and every Quantum quantum mechanics and quantum physics equation

02:05:37	has that square root of two in there we've been living in this lie this fostered lie for so long because and what's the solution to that the solution is learning how to multiply volumetrically How the Universe multiplies and I've already produced all of these things could you explain that though to the to the lay person how does the universe multiply volumetrically as opposed to the way it does not move does it linearly it does not walk on all of our math is based upon a two-dimensional projection what they do in calculus they

02:06:11	will reduce one act if the action of all things they'll keep trying to reduce it down to one moment because they believe Newton's first law that everything is moves in a straight line or everything is still until acted upon they forget that everything is in motion and that concertive motion is a necessity they have to include all the other forces involved in order to have equinity in their equations and so how in a practical sense does this affect mathematics well once we let go of cartisian space and the 90° angles well

02:06:49	picture this let let's take another practical look at a computer chip it has all of these 90° turns on it typically where they run the electricity can you imagine running at is being being built up from the interference in comparison to if it was just spherical just going around it would build up no heat and if you allow it to be spiral which my patent was talking about that first patent was talking about you're able to utilize all that energy so you don't need the cooling systems you don't need all this loss or

02:07:45	entropy none of that occurs when you go by Universal standards that's all they have to do is follow what the universe does we have the the contractive side patented ready and available we have the expanded side patented worked out already ready and available and we've got the Constitution between the two of them but right but how does that affect in a practical use if you're using math on a calculator what is wrong with what the calculator is saying the calculator right now is still saying that we're on

02:08:22	a linear path and it's just multiplying things in a COR in a compartmentalized space so by reductionist Viewpoint by breaking things down to simple numbers that you really can't just do that you you you can try to do it but it's like the piano remember the piano the earlier pianos they had before they compartmentalized and everything was remember that everything in the universe expands as a sphere everything even music expands as a sphere but what they did with the piano is they took all the 12 notes and then they just start them

02:09:02	all over again instead of accounting for the expansion that space so you would never if you're looking at the periodic table you would never get to the titanium or to the rubidium or to the cesium because they would all keep it with just the seven tones they don't allow for the necessary expansion so you don't have all of these other Isotopes to use because they keep things here you don't allow your child nope nope nope you're not going to get taller I need you to stay just at at at four feet

02:09:37	that's the height that's that's how high you can go you will now be allowed to grow further and we naturally keep growing and expanding out so they have to allow that but their math doesn't allow it because it believes in a two-dimensional space and remember there are no two-dimensional spaces because in order for anything to be perceived it has to be measurable and measurable needs three dimensions but it actually needs four it needs your perspective you are the fourth dimension and that's what

02:10:07	Walter Russell also talked about that it was four things coming together and that's what woke me back up and I was like four bubbles meeting but he still believed in the idea of straight lines he was still hemmed in in by it and he's right there becomes a cub sphere there comes a point where everything comes together but even hold on I'm going to try and pull up is it because that we can create straight lines that we get confused we can't create it because even when you look at it under an electron

02:10:39	microscope you'll see all the little curved dots that make it up there are no straight lines like if you look at this even in a box if you looked at this you'll say oh that's a square right there right the middle you'll see that square happening right there but if you look at it from the side from its real perspective you see that it's not the straight lines are an illusion again we are being fooled by our senses because there is no Motion in the straight line so all these homes that they're building and they keep

02:11:11	wondering why do they keep blowing over why don't you make the the homes look like a mushroom follow the curvature of Nature and you won't have to worry about rebuilding them in Hurricane zones or in in tornado zones it'll go right over it they they don't make airplanes that's just a straight box they've allowed it to be aerodynamic and curved they moved away from the straight lines in that that aspect in boats they don't have a you know the Noah's Arc moving across like this they don't do that like I said

02:11:43	no man would be attracted to a cartisian woman to to to a ukian woman something just straight like this we we need the curvature like Alan wad said we need the Wiggles we like we like The Wiggles attached to it yeah that makes sense about homes why they why do they keep making them flat when and they keep getting blown over I don't know what the [ __ ] they're easy to make they're easier to make but it's easier to make the curved ones it would be much simpler to do it but all of our technology is built

02:12:15	on these bricks of the platonic solid so now we have new building materials with what I've introduced entirely new building materials that we can use that have proven and it's super symmetrical that you don't have to just stay with the with the rectangle yeah you can do anything you want and you can produce energy will you I want to show the magnetic field we've talked about the electric field will you show the video for um it's a light column let me pause real quick I got to take a leak let's

02:12:48	pause and we'll come back to that so uh pick it up with magnetic field we we'll know where to do okay where were we magnetic what here it is yes so okay this is this is me taking this is the feminine side and me taking four of them and stacking them on each other we my wife ran one string of lights down the middle of it but watch as this spins what is this that I'm looking at I called it light sculpture it's my transcendental lighting wow a new form of lighting this is insane this looks like a psychedelic experience

02:13:28	but this is this is repeating this is rebuilding and predicting the wavefield the entire wavefield of how it behaves that's what the magnetic field does again Jimmy that's why I call it transcendental lighting because you could sit up there sober and get taken into an entirely new place and I just spent it I have it on a little little string at the top and I just turned it yeah if you just make one of these and have it rotating on some sort of a engine people would just trip balls staring at that and nobody is you know it's like I

02:14:09	can completely change the lighting industry and that's just one of the conjugations inside of their the gift that I gave you you'll see how the magnetic field bonds it into interacts with itself how they overlap if you take those off yeah take those off of there that's the electric field what you have right there all those are Define the electric field and you see they're contractive MH but inside of there you'll see that the magnetic field how did you make these I take acetate and um I might

02:14:45	think is I take acet I take acetate you know and draw out the flour on it I take the pieces of the flower and then I use a soldering soldering you know so you make all these by hand build all those by hand so what this is crazy that right there is the light if you take that's that right there what you're holding in your hand if you no no no take uh where six bubbles meet that that is the Decay this is electric and this is the magnetic side of it this is that at its Decay this is when the light is expanded

02:15:20	out this is the decay of the light field when it becomes a magnetic thing a magnetic expression light is blue no electricity is blue light comes out in in yellow and reds and how is this concept of taking these forces and converting them or representing them as these shapes how is this received nobody has has responded to it they won't the the universities I went to Morgan State because of um a really really beautiful brother um brought me up there to Morgan State because he saw these things yeah no I'm

02:16:02	good um he saw these things and he we set up an entire presentation at Morgan State Dr Bardwell even though I've written we've got three papers that's been peer-reviewed you know the geometry of the proton and the tetrion um that's been peer-reviewed he said there's no way way this guy knows any of this stuff and so he knows any of the things inside of here so no one from the science departments showed up so they bust in children from from different schools and I talked to them and I showed them how

02:16:39	the universe work and then they brought like 20 phds from outside um that came in and I showed them how the universe really behaves you know but none of them spoke on it out because what happens what happened to R rert sheld Drake when you speak against the established Norm you get pushed outside you don't get funding anymore but I think part of the problem is also that when someone defines someone as uh one particular occupation and for you it's you're a very talented actor so people you're a

02:17:13	very talented actor my opinion and so people think of you in that way and say there's no way he's awesome at something else too yeah well a a lot of that happened like you said the guy that interviewed interviewed you for Rolling Stone yeah Eric Eric I invited him into my home for two days and I walked him through all of these things but he had an agenda at Rolling Stone they didn't say Terence Howard has discovered this that they said Terrence Howard a very dangerous mind so you put that kind of

02:17:46	did they mean that in a complimentary way I didn't read the article so I can't wasn't taken in a complimentary way so they thought you were crazy they took it as crazy right and he tells you that I had something serious but to everyone else I want to take you guys to something where um remember Nicola Tesla said man said if mankind understood the magnificence of the numbers 36 and9 he would have the keys to the secrets of the universe if you will go to the lynchpins bonding can I bring you back to the Rolling Stone thing though before

02:18:23	because you kind of abandoned it I think no I'm going to show you I'll show you agenda they had an agenda because remember at the same time they were calling me a wife beater and all of those things and then I put out the video showing what that same woman that had painted in a black eye those pictures weren't made at the police station or at the hospital she took those pictures herself and she was was blackmailing me for years because I used to I had um when we met and I was studying to be a Jehovah's

02:19:02	Witness I was trying to do all those things so we you weren't having any sex or any of that stuff so we got engaged and I bring her to um my home in Philly and I had this tape because I anytime I had interactions with somebody I'd heard that um that um that Louie Louie Armstrong recorded everything around him you know same thing with Marlon Brando I recorded all these all his interactions with people so I was recording things and if I'd had phone sex with some girl I was recording that if we were having

02:19:37	sex I recorded that because I wanted to make sure there was proof of you know if anything happened but I also recorded my mother the last two weeks before she died and I had that on a Dictaphone and I didn't play with computers at the time and um she was like oh uh why you got this on on the dictaphone I can put it into the computer I was like oh great and we can keep it forever wonderful you're so wonderful I go downstairs I'm cooking some greens two hours later I come upstairs all of my dictaphones from the last 15 years she

02:20:11	has downloaded into her computer and then she's like I was like no no those are my private things I don't oh no it's okay I can just hit delete and so I was like okay great and then 3 months later when I tried to break up with her because we had no sexual you know there was no chemistry chemistry sexually she was like you think I erased those things I kept those and I know what you've done and and she started with the blackmail and all I really wanted back was my mother's tape you know where she told me I know

02:20:46	you're going to be okay Terry I always knew you were going to be okay I just wanted my mother's voice back I paid her whatever money she wanted she destroyed that she destroyed my name but like I said I thought that was a death blow but that's what took me back when I had nothing that's what took me back to this and that greater being started showing up again and you think if that had not happened you probably would have gone further and further down the world of acting and you would have abandoned this

02:21:16	oh my goodness I had you know I was doing Iron Man yeah out of nowhere you know that gets taken away we did a three picture deal with with Marvel a three picture deal 4 and A5 million for the first one um 7 and A2 to 8 million for the second one 12 million for the third we signed it they come back to me the week that my mother dies my a my and they call my agent um Charles King over at he was at William Morris at the time and they said um yeah we want Terren but we we we want come back for a million dollars instead of the 8 million that we

02:21:55	had agreed to and my agent had an emotional reaction to a business decision and he said f you and hung up the phone well immediately they go to Don Cheeto oh and but instead of just doing that they had to spin oh he was terrible on set and all of these things and went through all this stuff and I'm calling Robert Downey Jr I'm calling him because when I was doing The Brave One with um with uh jod Foster um Susan Downey was a producer with Joe silver um she comes over to my my my my trailer and she's like wow it's so

02:22:34	amazing um congratulations on Iron Man it's the first time they've hired um the second lead before they've hired the first but Robert wants to go in there and they were talking about Clive Davis and all of that and I was like okay great you know I'm just moving along doing my thing and he she was like but Robert really wants to go in but they won't see him and I was like I was like I love Robert I love what he does I loved him in in in Weird Science I loved him who did they want they they wanted

02:23:02	Clive Davis to play to play because remember in the series War Machine was supposed to take over right and I'm like well if Robert wants to come in so I called Avia Rod immediately he was the producer on it and I'm like a um I hear Robert wants to come in but you guys won't even let him audition he's like no we can't bond him I'm like instead of the four and a half you want to give me why don't you take a million dollars for the bond for him if he gets if if if and and let him audition you know and so he gets the

02:23:38	part Robert is like I love you thank you so much da d d d d da well when this other thing happened I'm calling Robert and he's doing Sherlock Holmes I called him 27 times and I'm like and leave a message I'm calling his his assistant I'm like I need the help I gave you I didn't hear from him until three years later I bumped into him at Brian graser's wedding and then but at that time I'd had um Empire or whatever and I came back he was like oh but everything worked out for you and you know

02:24:13	um that that broke me a little bit but I know how hard Robert had it coming out of jail coming out of that jail and so if I was if I had to sacrifice myself in order for that because guess what if if uid or any of them had discovered one of the wave conjugations they would have been happy I was given not just the one I was given the entire electric field and magnetic field and the Constitution between them so I was given so much more and my wife when she first saw the mirror all shape you know um if you open

02:24:56	it up you'll see it's the it's right here my wife looked at this the feminine side cuz that's all I had really gotten to at that point and she was like this is what you'll be remembered for and your acting will be just a footnote and you know she nursed me back to life because I was angry I was really angry and I was going to use all of the knowledge that I had and I was going to destroy mankind was like oh my God right out of Marvel I was like yeah I was about to but then I'm glad you didn't um now it's

02:25:46	I know I'm here to help mankind this is you know have the universities check out what I'm doing well it's one of the most fascinating things about this is that it's so easy to ridicule when an actor has some thing that's outside of acting that changes everything if you were just a person if you were just a person who went to school became fascinated with these Concepts became obsessed and made it your life's work and you know maybe you acted in college a little bit no one would care no but you would be become successful as

02:26:22	an actor as a bad guy yes and then You' gone through all that [ __ ] so you gone through all that [ __ ] and now they're like no no no no that guy there's no way those are threshold Guardians though it's a necessary step for it I would gladly trade whatever hundred million dollars I would have made doing that for this right here what I've been able to do right here like I said when Tesla said if mankind could understand the significance of 36 and n and half keys to theit universe will you

02:26:51	play that video for me Jamie lynchin bonding yeah the Lynch pin bonding it's the it's I think it'll be well there there's there's three of them yes that one right there now before we play it um if you count the struts and watch how many struts Bond as it becomes this right here okay and just count it as it goes just let it let it play you'll see one 1 2 3 and we know this is a magnet magnetism because it's expanding in the center now you'll see six of these bonds and those colors going across

02:27:34	there is basically the periodic table five six yep and then the last one comes in and now you have your nine and this is magnetism like I said magnetism expands at the center so you have your 369 and it's back to that same fractal again so now what you if you will do me a favor so when Tesla said that what did he mean he was talking about these numbers this this interaction of these three six and N but this is all of them coming around the tetrion at at 120° w this is how they all behave and this is the fractal because it keeps

02:28:23	getting back to these four vortices but now I want to show you after let this go again so they could see it how all of this this is the grand unified field put together now I want to show you electricity in this space which will be the next one and you'll see five Lynch pens bonding and you'll see that it collapses the dodecahedron and that's the release of energ but it'll still make that same tetrahedral space watch so when I talk about materials engineering now being able to be manipulated and you could see that that

02:29:08	the doca hedrin has been collapsed and these other because electricity is seeking higher pressure conditions it's more dense and but we're back to the and these five will keep bonding with other fives building predictable structures not halfhazard things these will four of these will come together and make a larger tetrahedron and then those will bond and make larger this is Jesus walking on water this is the proof in the pudding they don't have this for their chemical engineering programs now they don't need

02:29:45	those models of just a ball and just that little Rod anymore they now have what what's necessary the carbon line is that yellow line in between it and when we put this in the Solar Apex and replace the sun with it it predicts every Star on the galactic plane the elliptic the ecliptic plane and the celestial plane every single star it predicts and when we put groups of Lynch pin it predicts entire relationships so now that's why I said the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is out the window because now with this combined with the

02:30:17	wave conjugations or with the mirror shapes you can whether it's expanding or Contracting we can now predict precisely where everything shall occur and the Lynch pins have been I've included all of that into the AI for the Lynch pens and the best thing about IBM and all of those other companies rathon taking my patent and making money off of it since I have priority since I invented it I can now use any Innovation that they've done off of my patent and not have to pay them a licensing fee really I have

02:30:54	priority wow so that's why I was like where is Elon must but they put all that they put all that crap out there and after that doctor did that stuff with the blood thing they think everybody's a liar but it's like I'm not just an actor one of the biggest things I've done is that patent arvr world that we live in doctor you mean that Elizabeth uh yes whatever her name was yes but that they think everything is a scam and then you have the Rolling Stones you have the guardian you have all these people

02:31:25	saying these negative things to where people wouldn't take it seriously and didn't even didn't even consider it so I'm like okay and in nature an animal isn't given horns unless it needs them so our society as humans we wouldn't be given this information right now unless we needed it unless it was necessary for our our continued um existence and survival we're about to destroy our planet but with this you don't need to you don't need to cuz now we know how to use the universe properly where you can

02:32:03	multiply what that gun we get more energy out of it than we put in which physics says is impossible and they gave me the patents to it but nobody wants to have a conversation when when you do you think that the origin of hominids that this is a naturally occurring thing that happens when a planet reaches a certain distance from its star in a goldilock Zone with the proper materials of course the pressure conditions created look at um so you think this is happening everywhere everywhere everywhere because everything is alive look at what happens

02:32:44	in the summer and you know in the Norther and por and they'll Alan watt said you'll see apples occurring at this time they'll say that the tree is Appling well that what happens with the planets oh it's peopling whoa this is just peopling this is what this is just what occurs at 93 million miles away from the Sun what do you think occurs after us well once we get pushed out further what happens we need nitrogen to to expand into to unwind into oxygen but since the nitrogen since when we get pushed

02:33:18	further out the nitrogen is so far out so we have to go deeper underground to have the pressure conditions that was equal to us having 93 million miles away from the Sun the deeper underground we go the less light we have and as a result of that skin begins to gray eyes get bigger all of those necessary things the things that we see in Aliens and all of that ends up taking place as the animal adapts to changing environment changing changing pressure condition we have to we have to change why is it that white

02:33:55	people are allergic to the sun because they've lived inside of a pressure condition where there was not as much sun there so when they get into this area where there's a lot of sun now you have melanoma and all of those other issues but if they're in their natural environment they don't have any of those problems so they have to keep recreating their natural conditions that allows them to have um what homogeneous nature with everything but we're living outside of of nature because we're acting on faulty

02:34:34	ideas faulty fundamentals we're still going with ukian straight lines when there are none and we would rather think we have understanding of the universe at 4% and keep the 96% as a and we invent all these science fictions black holes and dark matter and dark energy and all of this stuff neutron stars that's spinning so quickly we invent all of these things because the math is off because the math is not based on equinity and they have Norm renormalization you know there's um I'm I'm not going to go down the

02:35:14	whole rabbit hole on it but all everything they've been doing that's why they keep recreating a new have a new theory for this now a bon and a go God particle and this and and you have the three Quark model and the gluons holding them together and now we have the four the five Quark model and we have all of these extra things that they keep inventing and they have the CERN collider smashing living things together smash because these these protons they're live everything is conscious there's a

02:35:48	like what's the where's consciousness exist in in our in and in in mankind is it in our head in our body what's the difference between men or or or mammals and and plant life do you think a a a grain of rice has 54,000 genomes in it we only have 26,000 who is more evolved but what's the difference between us if you Jamie could could pull up the I have a picture showing hemoglobin and chlorophyll and you're going to notice that the hemoglobin has the same exact combination of carbon and hydrogen that we have the only

02:36:33	difference they have is the center of theirs is magnesium and the center of ours is iron that's the only difference you put a seop pod up there it would be copper the same interaction of chem so where does Consciousness occur where where does where does the cient being is it is it just in the iron or is it the Magnesium deals with the pressure condition like with a seapod it has to have Copper at its base because of the pressure condition the same experience just under a different temporal Dimension change the pressure condition

02:37:10	change the motion condition you change the organism it adaps but it's the same living principle there's no difference between us and the plants that when people are chopping down and ripping things off just because they can't hear them scream it's it's wrong so tcot tlc.com we put all the patents inside of the center for truth Lov and Consciousness that's what TC tlc.

02:37:36	com means because I knew that I have a propensity to get angry and get emotional and could misuse this stuff so we have a board of members that dictate how these things will be LIC out and how they're used so it's not just on me so where do you think Consciousness is coming from everything is alive everything is conscious everything is like if you take it from the biblical thing what part of the universe wasn't made from the the Creator that he picks up some other if the Creator is eternal so we just don't

02:38:12	think of them as being alive because they don't move and they don't talk to us they don't we don't speak their language we don't have the sensory ability to perceive their Consciousness but we know we've learned like if you look at the secret life of plants they show that they'll take plants of the same mother and father and they'll seedlings and they'll watch the root growth and the because they are siblings they are moderate in their root growth but then they'll take the same species

02:38:41	of plant but use a different seed from another parent and they're more aggressive in their root growth wow they're Cooperative in of yes they're when they're in the family the tree they'll take they'll take um radioactive carbon or nitrogen and put it on the leaf of a a mother tree of a fern of of of some kind or fur tree and they will put um uh isotope or radioactive um identifier at the at its Offspring and you'll see that that mother tree is through the Mycelia is taking that nitrogen and giving it to

02:39:18	its to its youngsters yes yeah they call out and they speak and they're interactive and they're share resources they're alive and sensient because everything is alive but we see everything as death as dead because of what the Bible said because it breathed into life you know and the universe is just one big exam big nothingness of dead there's nothing dead in the universe everything is alive and everything is a piece of God so when God when we do good things then God is considered God is good when

02:39:54	we do bad things God works in mysterious ways it's just how we are behaving and we can all take the conscious level and recognize okay somebody's got to do the right thing and if you do the right thing the right things happen and you're going up against the stream of mankind but I've got the entire universe behind me I have the universal phenomenon and observe able evidence and data that stands behind it and 97 patents and trademarks and copyrights and multiple industries that I've invented nobody

02:40:28	else have ever invented tangential flight and ability to FL or unlimited midair bonding there's also a lot less confidence in the Stream of mankind than there used to be there's much more of an understanding that the stream of mankind is often going in the wrong direction because of the Michaelson moley experiment in 1887 and because special relativity took off and that meant oh everything is dead so we have no responsibility to anything everything has happened stance we all got here by one big explosion and

02:41:05	therefore life has no purpose nothing has a purpose and so now we can kill off these things and but they haven't looked at hemoglobin and and chlorophyll they haven't looked and said okay wait a minute let's do the law of similarities of a is equal to B and B is equal to C then a is equal to C my view is this if you know one thing about one thing you know one thing about all things find the common factor and either multiply or divide that common factor happens to be hydrogen everything in that we in the

02:41:37	observable universe that we see is 99% hydrogen well now we have the geometry of hydrogen so now we can manipulate 99% of the universe and there's nothing we can accomplish but they're still trying to make that money yeah that's the problem the problem is we're we're contained and confined by this desire for constant NeverEnding growth in money and to control Industries and to control people's ability also to express themselves you know which is a big factor in this strange new world that

02:42:15	we're living in where almost anybody can express themselves yeah things get very weird and slippery if you have been used to being in control for the entire time and now you can't and so on an idea like this if you're correct this is not just groundbreaking it's uh it's revolutionary it's revolutionary this has never occurred where someone has completely destroyed the talic model of the uni of of the solar system they had 39 different equations of how the planets and all that moved and of course

02:42:45	you're going to get ridiculed which is always what happens oh when when someone comes especially someone like yourself who again became successful in a different field you know and now all of a sudden you're saying this like again if you were a regular person that didn't have a background wasn't famous for something else they they'd probably be looking at this very differently but no they still wouldn't accept it because it it challenges their entire last 5,000 years of knowledge it means that the people

02:43:18	they give all this credit about the pyramids if those were built by an advanced civilization and I'm not saying they weren't built by someone that used other things but I believe those things came initially from a 100 200,000 years ago and the shape was more like this but after people had been removed or the influences of the individuals that made them like this they now was like okay we're just going to make them with straight lines and they limited themselves to that because they opened up the Flower of Life

02:43:56	incorrectly they invented straight lines where even God can't make a straight line because of his rules the rules their rules of equinity what do you mean by 200,000 years ago there's over aund 13 something thousand years worth of water damage under the Sphinx itself where do you get that you can look it up on well I've talked to Robert shock who's a geologist at Boston University and he thinks that there's a lot of water damage on the temple the Sphinx but he he doesn't think it's that old he thinks it's

02:44:30	thousands of years of rainfall thousands of years of rainfall but that's just after the cutting of the stone you know and it's it's a disputed thing it's not universally accepted it's a fantastic Theory but other go backy Tempo go back Tempe Tempe you go back there those what they've done with the carbon dating on that in itself is like 13 14,000 years old I think it's 11 I think it's 11 it was buried 11 purposely buried which is the fascinating aspect of it that the uh the dating is universal through the

02:45:04	ground which shows that it was purposely buried 11,000 years ago so that would put the construction time previous to that they don't know though but look at the at some of the maps that came out of out of southern Europe not southern Europe southern Africa right that showed Antarctica in its full right and how it behaved long before they were able to do a number of things they were able to do right when they didn't really even know it existed until I think it was those oral Traditions go back a 100,000 years

02:45:35	those oral Traditions don't go back you know 6,000 or 5,000 years so what do you think happened mankind I mean I'm well okay let let let's let's un prce if we are 98.7% identical to Simeon right right and there's only 1.3% differentiation who's more evolved we're considering ourselves to be more evolved but you look at the simeons they have 48 chromosones we only have 46 where did that change occur where did we get this new understanding and how did we lose two two chromosomes even though we're

02:46:20	98.7% identical and behave just like them there's that 1.3% differentiation whether you want to call it the anaku or some other influence that acted upon us but there's been a change within our DNA and our structure and we were given the Samar the Samaritans the samarians were given their number system that's where the 1 Time 1 equaling one came from so I'm and their system of of straight lines or the platonic solid so my thoughts is the individuals that wanted us here to whatever work whatever

02:47:04	manipulation they did for us they wanted us to have a system of measurement but something that could not contradict not given us the full picture so they gave us a limited scope where we can measure small areas but we would never need the larger areas we would never need to be able to move out in space because we were engineered for a particular reason and those stories you go right back every civilization has similar Stories the Hindus have those same Stories the Africans with the doans the doans I think same story all of these stories

02:47:44	proliferate around the entire globe in the ancient tra Traditions but what what did the Catholic church do they went through all of these areas and destroyed all of those books destroyed all of that information why what just like the Taliban blew up the Buddhist statues why yeah why did we destroy all of the Native Americans um all of their information what was the purpose of it there's a dumbing down that's that's happening well it's also a forc compliance right comply with the new ideology whoever is in control whether

02:48:23	it's the Catholic church or is the United States government in the 1800s that prevented Native Americans from speaking their native language yeah now if you if you're correct with this concept of a sun ejecting particles which eventually over billions of years form planets and then there's a natural occurrence that happens we we're intelligent life forms emerg and that this happens everywhere through the universe and that there are steps and that these steps that are past where we are is what we look on the iconic

02:49:00	form of aliens with the large heads and the big eyes and the tiny spindly gray bodies this if we go to other planets and we do especially with drones if something knows how to travel here from somewhere else and understands this process because this process is ubiquitous throughout the entire universe everyone and at a certain level of technological sophistication and understanding of matter itself especially if they have already figured all this stuff out a million years ago they would probably want to experiment

02:49:37	or even accelerate the evolution Advan our advancement and it appears our advancement happens very unnaturally I think most biologists will agree that the biggest mystery in the entire fossil record is the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years it's a very very very fascinating point it's a real it's it's not debatable doesn't it scream manipulation from an external Force something right something it screams something took place cuz an it's an extraordinary something and if it's

02:50:15	the something that takes place that's responsible for the single most bizarre animal on the planet the one that can manipulate its environment in a way that nothing contemporary can do nothing along side that lives with it in the same timeline is even close nothing's even remotely close it's very very very different but it's also extremely flawed for something that has such a high level of technical sophistication because of our fundamentals because we're still barbaric flat we still we we know the world the

02:50:51	universe and the world is is round but we're still using flat principles to to approach it right and so if you were a super sophisticated creature from another planet and you needed some particular materials from our planet and the anunaki story is all about gold they needed gold fixing up that yeah that the idea was that they were going to and this is all from Zechariah sitchin's work right and the idea was that they were going to suspend gold particles in their atmosphere in order to protect their environment um because they had abused

02:51:26	yeah they had abused it I think there was also some speculation about volcanic eruptions that volcanic eruptions had probably ruined their their atmosphere as well but they had the ability to do something about it and the way to do something about it is to mine gold and that they took us and they created us from the from the hominids the the reason why that's so interesting is because gold is [ __ ] useless 10,000 years ago why do you need gold no one needs gold if you're surviving if you're a hunter gatherer gold means jack

02:52:02	[ __ ] to you why is it the number one method of currency throughout all human beings all over the world well remember they abandon remember for a long time like if you're speaking if you're thinking about Italians they talk about they it's salt the soul yeah it was salt salt for Sal was what we used for currency in exchange for the gold we used so where did the gold come why did we have an appetite right for it if it wasn't placed into us if it does not sustain us in any way it's very intriguing it's very intriguing because

02:52:38	it doesn't do anything you can't make a weapon out of it you can't make a tool out of it it's too soft um it's they wer necessarily doing Electronics but silver is even more cond Ive if you want it for electronics silver is like 17 times the conductivity of gold well they weren't even using it for now right but they did use silver as well silver was also uh used as currency but not like gold Gold's the king always has been gold is number one so why do we love it why do we need it why do we trade life for it

02:53:12	always why have people like risk their lives traveling across the sea with wooden boats filled up with it to the where they sink and then we find these [ __ ] bones these dead soldiers M surrounded by gold coins it's crazy one of the greatest things about the Lynch pin is it's also submersible and so one of the main points is you know I'm about to build five smaller ones the only thing that I'm missing right now because we've have we have built a ton of we've got like 20 different prototypes that so so when you

02:53:45	say submersible you mean trans medium no trans medium they can go under like these uaps yeah but no we can go underwater and be able to go now maneuver through be able to grab they can identify where that gold is oh God and now they can go down and pull it up themselves without even informing the government about it I don't need any of that other stuff it's and I think that's why this has been suppressed when I first took it over to ran I had um I have these two test pilots you know both konel you know within been there for 30

02:54:22	years one at Boeing one at ran he said let's the the people at ran said let's see if he can keep it they didn't know I had all these other patents surrounding it that I they had no idea but it's usage if they use it the world changes in a beautiful way if they ignore it we cease to exist because we'll continue down this wrong path so do you think that intelligent life in all places of the universe has figured this out already if they're traveling here they have because you don't use power to go

02:55:00	from one place to another you decouple from the electric pull you decouple from the earth and guess what the Earth pulls away from you at its speed you decouple from the solar system it pulls away at its at its speed you decouple from the Galaxy it pulls away from you that's all you really really need to do but they didn't know how to decouple in two years I won't need props anymore I'll use molecular excitation which is all inside of the patents that I've put in there so the one of the things about this whole back engineering

02:55:33	thing that you keep hearing about with uaps the back engineering is gravity propulsion systems is that there's a system this is what Bob Lazar talked about this A system that uses a stable element called Element 115 that was just theoretical until they discovered that it actually exists in a particle collider in the 2000s so he was talking about this in 1989 and what he's saying is that there's some sort of stable element that gets bombarded with electricity and it creates this gravity wave that you can

02:56:08	do that or you can just like with music use a disordinate tone and those tones would push away there's a particular tone that the Earth is on there's a particular tone the key of A it's 432 Hertz the Schuman resonance all you have to do is have the opposite tone to that and it will be pushed away from it you don't the same way a bubble at the bottom of the ocean doesn't use any energy to get to the top but because it's completely in in opposition to its environment the environment push pushes

02:56:49	it away that's what you do if you're an intelligent race you can use a ore if you're trying to swim across the ocean you can get across there but an intelligent species like Alan watt said will use a cell and they'll Tack and make their way across you use the energy that's what Judo is it's supposed to be the Dow the Dow way which is the woo way which is not forcing anything and they the Japanese just say Judo in a in a harsher sense but it still means using the energy of your opponent against it

02:57:25	without expressing unnecessary energy so you just use the equal and opposite forces of tones it's you can do all of this stuff with with tone you don't need to use any electricity Beyond creating the frequency that's what the beos use not the beos the singing group but uh those beos that they have in uh the Scarab beos and those people that were doing those experiments with it that's what these shapes used properly vibrated properly it's a levitation and so that would be the method of propulsion method

02:58:06	of propulsion and also decoupling and so it wouldn't show visible means of propulsion just like these uaps don't show visible means of propulsion they don't have a heat signature no so they'd be operating on something entirely different that's allowing it to propel and then you could figure out how to manipulate that how take the frequency of the earth and find out what's the equal and opposite tone to it wrap your ship in there and how fast could this thing go you decouple from the earth you move at what's the Earth

02:58:40	moving at th000 miles an hour or so takes 24 hours for it to get around you know how quickly is our solar system spinning yeah whatever that tone whatever that frequency is whatever that speed is you decouple from the solar system now the solar system moves away from you so in that sense you could move at insane speeds and not experience gForce no nothing whatsoever and that's what the Lynch pin or the angles of incidence allows because now we can decouple from these six relative positions so when we feel gForce like

02:59:16	when you're in a have you ever flown in a fighter jet before you feel those insane G forces like what what that is is the resistance of the Earth itself of the earth of the spin of the Earth itself of our centripetal place where we are with the remember the Earth is spinning uhhuh the solar system is spinning and acting a force the the the Galaxy is spinning and acting on it and now for is pushing so if you decouple from them then you have no Force pushing you through and you can essentially travel instantaneously to anywhere if

02:59:50	you have the right frequency the right frequency it's all frequency it's all frequency and now and the right angles of incidence you can't get there with cartisian space or ukian 90 degrees 45 degree things you cannot get there you have to have the the truth and that's why I think I was given all of these things is like hey let's stop destroying the planet you don't need oil to to do all of the things you're doing you know we can now take right now we're writing a patent um I'm working with um Jeff he

03:00:26	um another mathematician that we worked and me and Chris are doing another patent but we're able to take the radioactive decayed water the stuff that they're using to cool those rods and use the proper angles of incidents and the proper field and can reverse that radioactive decay to in in days and not take a hundred years in order for it to do it's just the change of pressure and motion conditions when I was talking to um Jeff ye about he was like well let's we can use neutrinos coming from the Sun

03:01:00	and and saw that there was a different relationship like I was saying before how radioactive decay happen seems to happen quicker around Venus or closer to the Sun and I was like is it possible that that's due to the change the greater pressure condition that's happening and therefore the electricity is able to have a greater effect upon it you know I was like oh no no how do you know that the pressure is greater you know at Venus and I was like oh you still think that you still think there's a void you know we'll send a probe there

03:01:31	and see how the pressure increases and send the probe out and see how the pressure decreases the greater closer to the the Sun or the the Apex or the the primary the closer to it the higher the pressure the further away the less the influence your child my child you get my child around me I've got a great deal of influence on it and he behaves the way I I expect him to behave you take them outside a you know to to a theme park and I'm not there they run crazy right because I'm not there to to act

03:02:08	upon them so you can use that for propulsion at the same time I feel like we could do a hundred of these podcasts but I think we should wrap this one up I know we we did we just did about three hours I I saw when I was looking at a lot of your stuff I was like damn he be sitting there talking for three damn hours what are they talking about but we didn't even we haven't even covered half of these things let's do it again I would love to let's do it again but if you like I said I'm very interested to see how this is

03:02:38	received and I'm very interested to see because I'm sure there's going to be a lot of people that want to be able to talk to I'm leaving I'm leaving those things with you beautiful just so that you can and if you go into my book you can walk through and I explain I'm going to listen to this podcast about 30 times just to try to get a a slippery grip on any of it but uh thank you I really appreciate you man I really appreciate you're a very rare person just you too man you made the challenge there's one

03:03:08	question I want to ask you before you go while you were on Fear Factor yes and you watched people making choices for that gold yeah what was your consensus about human nature in comparison to what dignity and integrity should move somebody to do in comparison for chasing that gold well I think for a lot of people first of all what happens is first the show becomes famous right so the show gets on television initially people do it because they want to be on television then the show becomes successful and people do it because they

03:03:46	like it they watch it home and they Wonder if they could do it could I do that like most people say the physical challenges like those would be interesting to me man I can't eat bugs I can't do that a lot of that's in your head and it's it's it's like anything it's just a challenge to see if you could overcome your Natural Instincts and like I ate a roach it was nothing it's no big deal I ate a bunch of things I I ate a cicada I ate a sheep sheep cicas are actually good like people cook them and there's

03:04:17	by the way you should cook them cuz there's a giant hatch about to go down right now and uh they were just showing images of these things coming out of the ground cuz it's like a 13-year cycle yeah and there's billions of them um and you eat them they're delicious great source of protein yeah a great source of protein people got to get past the idea eating bugs but so then people started doing the show because they wanted to see if they could do it and you know some people are in credit card debt you

03:04:42	know they're young they want to take a chance it might be fun you know yeah but it's at the end of the day there's a certain amount of self-respect that that comes up to like if I'm forced to eat a slug or something of that nature if I'm on like naked and afraid it drives me crazy because they don't even get paid for it they go out and get these parasites and and for life that changes them for life and it's just for the freaking experience no that's why we put on clothes you know it's the clout

03:05:11	they want to be on television people want to be on television so bad and I think being on television is the worst thing that has ever happened I feel like an emotional [ __ ] you know because they don't appreciate that that I'm tapping into something sacred some sacred emotions and now and I'm just turning tricks for John's turning tricks and if I do a great job turning this trick then they'll they'll do a gang bang with their buddies pH literally and and and figuratively you know and that's what

03:05:41	they want to do it they want to make all the money out of you turning your tricks Bingo yeah but the thing is like for the person that watches it it's entertainment and it's very valuable like wow what a great [ __ ] movie you leave you feel inspired you want to create you know there's positive to it too I could see how you look at it as a negative experience but particularly you produc because you have so much more to off well yeah there's always you're always going to get pimps yeah that's

03:06:06	and I love interacting with the people and and and I love the the the growth of that I love when people say you help me through a really dark area because even when I play bad guys I'm like I'm trying to find I'm finding the I know that bad person is just missing something that it wanted and needed like all humans yeah just a hug just a right hug and you know and somebody understanding them I'm going to leave with this one last thing okay um I was on the plane once and I always ask the older people when that's

03:06:36	sitting next to me what's the best advice you can give a young man you know I was 33 and this when we were going over to Germany this will take one minute we're going over to Germany and I asked this one guy that was like 70 years old and at moment as we were on our way he said if you look out the right side of the plane you you'll notice the island of iiza and he got real quiet and then five minutes later he said have as much sex as you can now this is before the Advent of Viagra whoa and then I was on coming

03:07:10	back from the Czech Republic um and a few years later and I asked this man as we got on the plane and he said next to me and he waited until we got all the way near La and as he was reaching up for his bags he said you got it what's the best advice you can give a young man so he can be good have the a successful life he said you got to remember in every person you meet there's a little piece of God in them and that's who you talk to and I added to that but make sure they see it in you first wow so

03:07:42	that's what my life principle is about Make Way for life please make way for life find the peace of God in you and show it Shine through it push it and and and take up your your your stake you know take up your steak and and and be the Messiah for the day and two days and three days if you can and be a rascal also I did I discovered half of this stuff while I was still watching porn it's not like I was just a monk I still watching porn and I'd come back and do these so it was like okay it's it's you

03:08:16	there's a balance that's a great advice that's a great advice that's a great way to wrap this up let's do this again we're going to do this again I love that 100% I can't wait reach out to Alon musk man it's and and Jeff B says if they want to finish I don't know Jeff but I know El Elon I would I got his solution we can clean up the upper atmosphere you know lynchpin is real it's real it's there I can I can't wait to see the response to this thank you Terence thank

03:08:43	you bye everybody thank you Jamie [Music] [Applause] [Music]
